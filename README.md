Let me add that there are new technologies coming that allow us to isolate fetal cells in the mother's blood. The fetal cells can then be tested to determine the fetal sex. These test were invented to help with certain sex-linked genetic disorders like hemophilia  where knowing the sex could avoid other invasive tests. I assembled some links about this technique (http://bitly.com/zjLhAU). Often it is possible to determine if the fetus is male or female during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

14	Q:52429A:64582	What are the pros and cons to circumcision? Although the American academy of pediatrics offer the opinion that circumcision has minimal advantage  it cuts down the risk of infections  penile cancer and phimosis  which can swelling around the penis. Analysis of all the available research data by the American Academy of Pediatrics demostrated a benefit of doing it versus the detriment of the risk. The benefit was described as   small    but this does mean there is an advantage to performing it than the risk of not. See Dr. Amster's answer P: Less urinary infections in first year of life  C:UTIs in otherwise normal boys are rare. P:Cleaner if U don't wash.C: clean if U wash. P: prevents penile cancer  which is rare. C:avoided with good hygiene.P/C:May or may not improve sex  not proven. P:Avoid phimosis or balanitis  reduce risk of HIV or HPV transmission during unprotected sex  like Dad or brothers if they are circ'd - ?important The cons are obvious. In babies  it's a minor  uncomfortable surgical procedure  though better with anesthesia they use now. Pros are a much decreased risk of urinary tract infection  closure of the foreskin around the tip causing obstruction  and skin cancers of the foreskin  which are something of an issue. Plus a much lower risk of sexually transmitted diseases.

16	Q:55120A:72536	Are fevers and teething in babies associated? Some babies have no symptoms at all. Most will have excess saliva  want to chew on things and perhaps be a little cranky.  A few may develop low grade fever and/or mild diarrhea.  If more severe symptoms develop the baby should be evaluated by their pediatrician as they may have a cold or illness in addition to teething. When babies teeth their noses run. They cannot blow their noses properly do the mucus backs up via the Eustacian tube and causes a middle ear infection. This is what causes the fever and not teething per se It is common for babies  when teething  to get a low grade fever.  If  however  the fever is associated with any other symptoms (cough  sneezing  nasal congestion  rash  unusual fussiness  unconsolable crying  etc.) contact your pediatrician or family doctor to rule out other possible causes for the fever. I would add that if your baby's temperature is above 101*F  teething is less likely to be the cause.

21	Q:55237A:72792	Should i circumcise my kids? Current research seems to be leaning in the direction of favoring circumcision by lowering infection and cancer rates.  You should have a head to head (no pun intended) discussion with whomever would be doing the operation.  Too often the procedure is performed simply as a routine  and sometimes just to make an extra buck  I'm afraid. There is no need for routine circumcision. So don't do it unless there are religious reasons  or you are circumcised and want your kids to be circumcised. Unless they they have an abnormal foreskin. A normal foreskin may not be fully retractible till age 10 years. Most foreskins can not be retracted before age 2 years.Don't you or let a nurse or Dr. try and force retraction of an adherent foreskin Babies are born complete  finished  and perfectly fine (except for the few unlucky ones with birth defects). Circumcisions are done for religious and cultural reasons  but the procedure does permanently change the genitals  so parents should think about it and talk about it before doing anything to their perfect little newborn.

Please don't push your baby 's luck We do not recommend any over the counter cough or cold medicines for children under 6 yrs.  humidifiers and nasal auctioning help clear mucus which many times is contributing to the cough. There is no cough suppressant that is proven safe and effective for a baby . Unless the cough is due to wheezing  where medication may help. Home remedies also do not really work. A vaporizer  fluids and saline nose drops are a bit helpful and safe  but are not neccessarily very effective. Cough medicines in study after study over the last 27 years have been proven ineffective & can have some bad side effects.This is why the FDA has finally started taking them off the market!

45	Q:133928A:199080	What is x linked occular albinism? Genetically speaking: XX=female  XY=male. X-linked mean the affected gene is located on the X-chromosome  and in this case it is a recessive trait. So  for female  1 good X and 1 affected X = ok because the good X   masks   the bad one. As for male  he only has 1 X..thus if this X is affected  he has no other X to mask  only Y  thus he has the disease. Genetic is fun  but can drive u nuts. Good luck This is a form of albinism  which is partial  and linked to a defect on the X-chromosome.  Because of this it occurs in males.  It has the much less skin paleness  grey blue eyes rather than pink and a little pigment instead of the totally wiped out albinism of the pure recessive type.  But these people still need to avoid the sun and may have some degree of lowering of vision.

My favorite parenting books are :Caring for Your Baby and Young Child  Birth to Age 5Caring for Your School-Age Child  Age 5-12Both books are published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Some of my favorites are Brazelton's books (strong on development)  AAP's Birth Through Five Years. Also  I'll go ahead on plug one of my books here    Solving Health and Behavioral Problems from Birth Through Pre-School  . Well  who gets to decide?  No one book works for everyone.  Read a few pages in the middle of each book you see in a bookstore; if it seems to make sense  it may be worth trying.  In particular  this book: http://www.amazon.com/Caring-Your-Baby-Young-Child/dp/0553386301 should get you around most pitfalls. One of my all-time favorites is    How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.   It focusses on building the most critical ingredient in healthy relationships: empathy -- that is  the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes.

54	Q:9428A:84695	†Are there other medical problems associated with albinism? The principle ones occur due to the lack of pigmentation of the eyes and the skin. Eyes are very sensitive to the sun and can have problems up to and including blindness. The skin problems are an extreme sensitivity to the sun which can lead to cancer. Albinism is caused by a defect in melanin synthesis  causing decreased pigment in skin and hair. The main medical problems associated with albinism are vision problems and increased risk of skin cancer.

55	Q:5944A:12933	Why is my baby having seizures? I agree with previous answers you need to see a pediatric neurologist asap. Seizures in infants are never normal. You should see your pediatrician  who can let you know what further evaluation should be done for your baby&#x27;s seizures. One caveat - sometimes parents will interpret a baby&#x27;s startle reflex as a &quot;seizure.&quot; The startle reflex is normal and does not need any treatment. Causes of seizures in babies includeabnormalities of brain structure and brain damageabnormalities of metabolismbrain infection.Contact a pediatric neurologist for an appropriate evaluation Seizures are difficult to assess.You need to visit your doctor to discuss what you are seeing.The why comes afterwards. A child neurologist is the top choice for babies with seizures.  Some seizures are caused by dehydration  low blood sugar  head trauma  family history (mom or dad have seizures)  high fever  infection of the brain or spine. These do not cause seizures for all kids; again  see a child neurologist to diagnose and treat your child&#x27;s seizures. Good luck! First of all  you want to make sure that your baby is having true epileptic seizures and not some other non-epileptic events. Causes of seizures depend on age and situation. There are many possible causes including fever  metabolic changes  prior abnormal brain development  brain injury  tumors  strokes and hemorrhages  and genetic causes. It is best to seek expert advice from your doctor(s).

84	Q:126017A:254471	Why do the bellies of malnourished children protrude so much? The protein in our diet is converted to usable aminoacids and plasma proteins that keep fluid inside blood vessels during the bloods transit throughout the body. Malnourished kids leak enema fluid  (water) into the organs & tissues because there is not enough protein in the blood to keep it from happening. The kids may look fat  but rather than fat this is water in organs & tissues. The abdomen protrudes due to multiple factors: fluid buidup in the empty spaces in the abdominal cavity due to protein deficiency; accumulation of fat in the livers due to lack of proteins to transport fat away from the liver; and the concurrent exposure in some cases of parasitic infestation.

You should do a PG test or see a doc for a blood PG test to see if you are PG. If you are not then no need to worry about labor and IF you are not and you are having intercourse at the YOUNG age of 14 which I do not recommend THEN YOU BETTER BE USING some type of birth control so YOU do not get PG.

94	Q:68808A:96584	how do kids get athsma? Many infants have predisposing factors such as Family history as well as a history of atopy or cows milk allergy. Some babies wheeze because they have reflux  others develop chronic wheezing problems secondary to infections such as RSV. Do not forget environmental factors such as second hand smoke and exposure to fumes. Environmental exposures; tylenol and NSAIDS; early viral infections of the upper airway all appear to be additional risk factors in addition to genetics.  Asthma is not a single disease  but rather a syndrome or cluster of symptoms - so it is not clear which factors contribute more to which   type   of asthma. Most asthma is part of the allergy/eczema/asthma triad which is controlled by several genes. Various factors controling the mechanics in lung pasageways trigger airway tigtening or relaxation over time an imbalance with excess tightening will emerge. Infection may trigger this in infancy but irritants  & other triggers will dominate. Meds can control it but true asthma is a lifelong tendancy.

95	Q:134A:15195	Can I eat sushi while breastfeeding? Yes and no. You may eat sushi as long as it does not contain raw seafood. Too many issues can arise with raw fish in sushi so I do not recommend it. If the sushi is freshly caught  from reputable dealers  managed and prepared correctly  it should pose no hazard to the mom  or the baby.   Listeria   is a concern with raw foods but if the above conditions are met it should be fine. Yes. Maybe! Because it is uncooked  listeria  a type of food poisoning can be a concern. Also  eating too much fish can be a source of mercury exposure. So  if you are sure the sushi is well prepared  fresh and comes from a reputable source  it should be safe. If in doubt  opt for something else. Avoid large predatory fish such as tuna or mahi-mahi  they are high in mercury.  And  of course  make sure it's fresh and of good quality. Fresh sushi from a reputable place poses no risk to your baby. As with eating any uncooked fish  infection is a risk  but only for you  not your baby. Some fish (salmon  flounder  sole) have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids  which help the heart and brain development of your baby. Avoid the fish with high levels of mercury (shark  swordfish  king mackeral). California roll  anyone? A breastfeeding mom   can   eat sushi  but it is safer to eat other foods instead of sushi.  One reason is the mercury in fish.  A person who eats more than 2 servings of fish a week may be taking in too much mercury.  A second reason is that sushi often has uncooked seafood in it.  Uncooked seafood can contain live viruses  bacteria  and parasites; but cooking the food usually kills those things. Sushi can be wonderful  healthful food during nursing. 3 health risks to know about 1) Mercury. Some large fish  such as bluefin tuna can have high levels of mercury. You may want to minimize these choices. 2) Parasites. Very rare in US. (<40 cases per year  mostly raw salmon or mackerel). Freezing  smoking  vinegar drops risk. 3) Pufferfish. Fugu has potent poison if not prepared right. Why risk?

Here is a clip to help  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7ke5D_115E of Pediatrics first  recommended in 2002 that pediatricians perform  developmental surveillance using standardized screening tests ( ASQ or PEDS)  at all well-child visits &amp; autism-specific screens ( M-CHAT or PDDST) at 18  &amp; 24 mos. Screens are being developed for earlier ages  since we now know that changes on brain MRI's &amp; diminished eye-to-face gaze can begin ~ 6 mos. See first signs.org. Autism is diagnosed on the basis of observed and reported behaviors.  There are structured tests that systematize this process  but it is a clinical diagnosis.  The clinician is looking for persistent problems in social interaction  language  and unusual behaviors.  Experienced clinicians often make the diagnosis within seconds; inexperienced ones can use the formal criteria and misdiagnose.

98	Q:297563A:425090	What is teething all about? Teething is a process when children have sensitivity when teeth come into the mouth and break the skin of the gums. As teeth erupt into the mouth they push on the gums causing discomfort  the natural reaction is to bite on something as pressure on the gums over the tooth relieves the pain for the moment.  thats why babies when they start to have teeth erupt are chewing on anything they can get in their mouths.  This also helps the tooth cut thru the gum tissue. over the counter topical anesthetics like Oralgel Teething  Mouth  Teeth  Gums  Children  Skin  Child Health Teething  Mouth  Baby  Teeth  Gums  Anesthetic drug  Incision  Tissue  Child Health Teething  Mouth  Teeth  Gums  Children  Skin  Child Health Teething  Mouth  Baby  Teeth  Gums  Anesthetic drug  Incision  Tissue  Child Health Teething  Mouth  Teeth  Gums  Children  Skin  Child Health Teething  Mouth  Baby  Teeth  Gums  Anesthetic drug  Incision  Tissue  Child Health

109	Q:20053A:24979	Okay to watch television while breastfeeding? The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended limited or no Tv under 2 years old. There are many many better ways to stimulate your baby's development. The TV should not be a substitute baby sitter. However let us use some common sense. Moderation of most things is never a problem.  If the baby is truly hungry  they will not be distracted. I can not imagine this to be a serious problem. You can watch TV while nursing  but don't miss this very special time to interact with your baby.  She will be gazing at you  and your face with be in focus in this position.  The light  sound and activity on screen may be distracting to older infants-in that case turn it off.  It's preferable to use this time to sing  say nursery rhymes  or just talk to baby-about anything and everything!  Enjoy! Sure  if the volume is low and you're not too close to the TV  it's not physically harmful to your baby...but what a missed opportunity!  News  sit-coms  and movies will come and go  but you're developing a bond with your baby that will last a lifetime.  Focus most of your energy on that little munchkin and you'll reap the benefits for years to come. This poses no health risks to the baby  but keep the volume low as the sound and lights may distract the baby from nursing well.  Make sure you continue to pay attention to your baby  they will be giving you cues as to when they are done  if they are comfortable  etc.  Nursing is a great time to bond with your baby so just make sure you don't tune out completely with the TV!

110	Q:600533A:921102	Is there any cure for autistic children? Cure is not the correct term and definitely not for those who have a genetic cause such as fragile X. You can  in some cases  make such significant improvements in the level of functioning that they no longer meet diagnostic criteria. This is  more likely the younger the child at the time intervention begins and the more multifaceted the approach.  Any delay deserves evaluation. There is seldom a   cure   in that all symptoms disappear but there are many interventions that relieve many of the most distressing symptoms of autism in many children. ver model is the only comprehensive Early Intervention model proven effective in reducing  autistic behaviors & increasing cognitive  language  & adaptive skills when begun  by 18-24 months &  continued  for at least 2 years at an intensity of  15 hrs./week by trained therapists + 5 hours:week by parents or caregivers. The goal is for the child's behavior to be indistinguishable from his peers'. Some individuals with autistic traits  especially at young ages may improve over time; e.g.  PDD. However  there is no   cure  but speciialized thera[ies  educational programs  behavioral techniques   social skills training  etc. can help ameliorate symptoms. Medication can often help too. The only proven method to help youngsters overcome autisms challenges is science based intensive individualized intervention using an applied behavior analysis model.

111	Q:130475A:197305	What are the chances of a person with albinism passing his problem to their children? The transmission of albinism will depend on the form involved. A   male may have an X-linked or autosomal recessive(AR) form. A female is most likely to have the recessive form. A  male would not pass it to his sons but could pass the carrier state to his unaffected daughters who might pass it to her sons.

119	Q:84993A:138695	What should we tell our teens about what to do if a shooter comes into their school? @DrPam Your school should have an action plan to deal with various types of crisis: natural disaster  fire  and  sadly  violent attacks.  Students should be aware of the plans and practice them on an annual or semi-annual basis.  There is no perfect way to deal with a violent attack - each attacker is different and the physical layout of the schools are different - but preparation helps ease the mind. Run  and get out of the building if you can.  Hide behind locked doors if not.

122	Q:160402A:285218	Are there any official online tests for adhd from gov or pediatrics websites? These questionnaires are never diagnostic.  Only a doctor can make a diagnosis and treat ADHD. See NIH website:  http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-easy-to-read/index.shtml. Also CHADD.org. The tests for ADHD are much more complex than questionnaires.  Visiting website is beginning. Then see your doctor if you suspect you may have it. Diagnosing ADHD requires input from parents  teachers and pediatricians.  Although you can find surveys online that can suggest if your child is at risk  a formal diagnosis would require a medical evaluation.  Please voice your concerns to your pediatrician who can help start the process. adhd is a clinical diagnosis.  there is no test for this disorder  not online  not in the doctor's office. There are no official online tests from the government or AAP recognized websites for the diagnosis of ADHD. It's diagnosed predominately from careful history taking and in-office observation.  However  there are questionnaires available online that can assist your doctor in making the diagnosis. One of the more widely used is the NICHQ Vanderbilt  which has parent and teacher versions.

129	Q:2066A:414	Is it ok to buy a used car seat? Need to check year that was made and seat beltsThere are some concerns that when the car seats are older than 3 to5 years old may not work well If a carseat is fairly new  and is not damaged  it should work just fine.  A parent should be able to thoroughly inspect the used carseat to be sure nothing is broken  cracked  or missing.  If a parent has very little experience with car seats  it may be wiser for him/her to just buy a brand new one. Car seats are like beds. We do not tend to buy used  mattress. Aso be mindful of numerous recalls and most importantly the new American academy of Pediatrics guidelines for infant and child car restraints.The new guidelines  for example call for kids to be rear facing until age 2. No doubt changes will be made in the car seats themselves. Used seats can have hidden problems. Seats are considered bad if : They were ever in a crash occupied or not. They have substituted parts  straps  buckles etc or visable repairs. They are past their usable age. The stickers on the sides are gone. If you get it from a friend who has all the parts and none of the above applies  it may be ok. You could have it inspected by a CPST Tech to be sure. Many local charities/programs/fire or police departments/ civic groups/ health plans/ etc  offer car seats for free It&#x27;s a great way to save money.  There is minimal risk of bedbugs because the framework is mostly plastic and metal.  Like any used objects  inspect carefully for defects and in the case of car seats...check with manufacturer that it was not recalled for any safety issues.  The fabric piece is easily removed for washing or replacement. I would advise against it.  I had at least one family find bedbugs in a used crib  and car seats are not much different. I'm all for parents trying to save money  but in this case unless you really know the seller  it's best to buy a new one. Any car seat that's been in a significant accident can be compromised  and may not offer good protection-- they're supposed to be discarded. But you never know if you're buying at a garage sale or thrift store what that car seat has been through.

130	Q:1026A:880	What causes Croup? Croup describes an inflammation of the windpipe  that can be caused by many different viruses. Typical symptoms include a barky cough and noisy breathing (stridor). Treatment consists of cool mist or steam  and sometimes oral steroids or breathing treatments. Croup is caused by a virus. Most commonly  the parainfluenza virus. This virus infects the upper respiratory tract  more specifically  the larynx (voice box) and trachea (wind pipe). This is why children with croup end up with a hoarse voice and the telltale barking cough. Cases of croup peak in the Fall and Winter and are generally most common in children ages 3 months to 3 years.

131	Q:126202A:288345	How do I keep my child's molluscum from spreading? Molluscum occasionally become itchy & scratching the area can spread it . A simple bandaid or other cover  can help prevent the spread if it is localized. If the area is broad  just ignore it as the body will eventually shed them all within a few months. If a few become inflamed as they begin to shed  treat as if a simple cut or scratch to prevent skin bacteria from causing a localized infection. It's not called   molluscum contagiosum   for nothing - those pesky bumps tend to spread locally on the body  and then to other kids' bodies. Stop it from spreading by having it treated. Dermatologists use a vesiculant called cantharidin  or freeze them with liquid nitrogen. Imiquimod cream is often effective as well  although that is an off-label use of that medication. The easiest way to spread molluscum is by scratching at dry skin- this typically unroofs the virus and then the child   auto-inoculates   another place on the skin. I generally recommend keeping the skin moist by using a good moisturizing lotion/cream at least twice a day. If the spots are becoming unsightly  call your doctor about possibly having them treated though they often go away on their own.

It is important to follow the trend over time.  If your child is below or above average but has been growing well and following their growth percentile they are likely healthy The   average weight   for an 11 month-old baby is about 21 pounds. However  the important thing is how a baby has been growing and developing  as noted at each check-up and as shown on his growth charts. Most babies are either above or below   average weight   (much of it is genetic or familial)  but when one averages out thousands of babies' weights  the answer is about 21 pounds at 11 months.

150	Q:798A:19621	Do daycare centers and schools require vaccinations? In the US  daycare center  preschool  or school can require you to provide proof that your child has been immunized. All public elementary schools require proof of vaccination for children entering school  and most private schools do  too.Exemptions are permitted for medical reasons.Mississippi West Virginia allow people to refuse vaccinations for religious reasons They require vaccinations with copies of vaccination records presented in a timely fashion (sometimes within a week of vaccination due dates). Daycare centers  schools  and our community as a whole  require childhood vaccinations so that our children won't suffer the great harm that many bad diseases used to inflict upon us. Day care centers and schools require vaccinations in order to protect your child as well as the other children. Diseses like whooping cough  chickenpox and measles that can safely be prevented  with vaccines  are now a mayor problem in many States due to unvaccinated children. Specifically what is required and when is outlined in your specific state's health laws. Most schools of all types require vaccination to enter  both for the child's good as well as for the protection of other students.  Some schools  especially some private schools  may not follow or enforce these rules.  Depending on your area of residence  many daycare centers and preschools follow similar rules  normally established by a state or local Department of Public Health. It is important for facilities caring for young children to enforce vaccine recommendations. This is because  many illnesses in children are transmitted from children who are in close contact with each other. Without these important regulations  childcare centers would be vectors for serious disease (which would put your child and others at high risk of life-threatening illnesses).

As long as your baby is regularly waking up for feedings sleeping a lot is nothing to worry about.  As your baby gets older they will sleep a little less and be wakeful for longer periods of time.

158	Q:1533A:16407	Why do babies stay in the NICU? When babies are born prematurely(generally less than 35 weeks)   have Respiratory problems  or a congenital problem with the Heart or other system  or infection  they may require a level of care that is not available/ appropriate for a General Level I nursery. NICUs have experts called Neonatologists who manage and supervise care of babies with special needs. Nurses have advanced training as well. Some babies who have infections right after birth need to stay in the NICU for treatment and close monitoring. Some babies may have underdeveloped lungs (such as premature infants) and may require a ventilator to breathe. Some premature babies may be in the NICU to work on feeding  which may require a special feeding tube. Others may have heart problems that need medical or surgical treatment.

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes or 46 total. During the formation of the egg  each pair splits and one of each travels to the egg. At conception  the sperm brings one of each  & the new embryo now has 23 pairs (two of each).  Any time one of the chromosome pairs doesn't split & gives a pair to the egg  a third will come from the sperm and a trisomy of that chromosome is formed.

170	Q:126892A:212968	Do you think that adhd is an excuse for misbehaving children? Misbehaving is part of poor impulse control which is part of ADHD. When I explain ADHD to children  I tell them     It's not your fault  but it is your problem.   The more specific information you give a child about his/ her strengths & weaknesses  how medications work  & what behaviors they need to work on  the better they cope. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder  not a behavior problem. See CHADD.org Oh  if life were so simple.  Misbehaving children can have ADHD or other conditions which influence irritability and impulse control  but that does not mean that behavior is a simple product of disease.  Consequences  rewards  modeling  stress  the child's intelligence  coping skills  all play a part.  ADHD children do have a higher frequency of oppositional and conduct problems  but not all. ADHD can cause children to behave impulsively and cause disruptions in many settings.  It is a treatable disorder for which medicatoins and good behavioral systems can greatly reduce problem behaviors.  That said  studies do show that those with ADHD tend to be somewhat behind their peers socially  so parents may need to help find the right structure for them.

These include histologic  biologic  and genetic factors related to individual tumors.  The only way currently to obtain this important information is via tissue analysis.  In cases where bone marrow is involved  the diagnosis can be established this way.  Otherwise  tumor biopsy in necessary. the purpose of the biopsy is to confirm the nature of the mass. if the biopsy is positive then chemotherapy can be started and a port or broviac inserted to facilitate administration of the chemo. oftentimes the mass cahn be rermoved at toime of biopsy. if too large or involving other organs a second look procedure can be done after 3-4 rounds of chemo. The diagnosis is usually suspected by age of patient  symptoms and imaging results.  However it is generally confirmed by a pathologist who looks at the biopsied tissues under a microscope.  Neuroblastoma tumors have a specific look under the microscope and are often described as small  blue and round cells.

186	Q:963A:25499	What is Bronchiolitis? Bronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2  and is even more common in the first 6 months of life. It is a common  and sometimes severe illness. Viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include: RSV  flu and adenovirus. Bronchiolitis essentially is swelling and snot in the smallest air passages in the lungs. If you think of the lungs as a tree upside down with limbs representing airways  the bronchioles are like the smaller branches and twigs where the leaves (air exchange blebs)attach. In broonchiolitis these air channels are often filled with excess mucous and may spasm with infectious swelling. The result is hampered oxygen exchange  wheezing and cough. Bronchiolitis is a viral lung infection that causes damage and mucous in the smaller airways (air passages) in the lungs.  Bronchiolitis is usually caused by the RSV virus  and occurs in babies and toddlers.  After age 2 years  children have better immunity and can usually block the RSV virus from damaging the lungs.  So  older children and adults just have cold symptoms when they catch RSV. Bronchiolitis is an infection of the smallest breathing tubes in the lungs (bronchioles).  The small airways become inflamed  swollen and filled with mucus.  This can lead to breathing difficulty.  It is caused by viruses such as RSV and influenza.  It is more common in children under age 2 and peaks at 3-6 months of age RSV  Bronchiolitis  Children  Virus  Mucus  Lung  Child Health Muscle spasm  Cough  Wheezing  Bronchiolitis  Oxygen  Lung  Contagious  Bronchiole  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Lung  Infection  Children  Virus  Immunity  Child Health Breathing difficulty  RSV  Bronchiolitis  Lung  Infection  Children  Virus  Breathing  Bronchiole  Mucus RSV  Bronchiolitis  Children  Virus  Mucus  Lung  Child Health Muscle spasm  Cough  Wheezing  Bronchiolitis  Oxygen  Lung  Contagious  Bronchiole  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Lung  Infection  Children  Virus  Immunity  Child Health Breathing difficulty  RSV  Bronchiolitis  Lung  Infection  Children  Virus  Breathing  Bronchiole  Mucus RSV  Bronchiolitis  Children  Virus  Mucus  Lung  Child Health Muscle spasm  Cough  Wheezing  Bronchiolitis  Oxygen  Lung  Contagious  Bronchiole  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Lung  Infection  Children  Virus  Immunity  Child Health Breathing difficulty  RSV  Bronchiolitis  Lung  Infection  Children  Virus  Breathing  Bronchiole  Mucus

191	Q:1368A:25824	What should I do if my baby wants to be held constantly? I believe that babies cannot be spoiled in the first few months of life.  I encourage parents to meet their needs however they can until they reach about 4 months of age.  At that point  the infants need to learn how to self-soothe. this is called separation anxiety.babies should not be held all the time Newborns need to be held. Up to a couple months of age  a baby only understadns if his needs can be met. Hold him all you can  but allow him always to learn to fall asleep by himself by placing him in his crib when sleepy. After this period s he becomes more interested in the world around him  play with him while he is on his mat or chair so he does not expect to be held all the time. I DO believe newborns can be spoiled.Thus it depends upon the baby's needs.A baby who is fed  burped  clean and otherwise comfortable enough to fall asleep is put down.Instantly they awaken only to fall asleep as soon as they are held.I generally put these rascals down and let them learn to self soothe ( fuss a bit).

If you want to use both breasts thats fine too. Babies get what they need in the first ten minutes of feeding. After that is all tender  love and care. Feed your baby every three to six hours. Dont wake him up in the middle of the night. Your rest is more important than that extra feeding Breastfeeding is typically recommended for a year by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  My advice is to go for as long as you can.  I thought I could only make it a few weeks  but each week added up and I made it to 6 months.  It can be difficult and there are great lactation specialists who can help  even come to your house if need be.  Also great is to join a breastfeeding support group!

These tests are mostly done by fertility specialists. Best wishes. I recommend seeing your Obgyn or a local infertility specialist. Most couples will get pregnant within one year of trying. If a couple is not successful after 12 months then it is time for evaluation. For female testing we start by testing for ovulation and an Xray called a HSG to make sure the tubes are open.

217	Q:16100A:22918	What is the best way to breastfeed a preemie? Aside from the technical challenge of breastfeeding  per se  you may have to navigate related challenges  like 1) Stress of the NICU experience itself. 2) Unexpected setbacks. 3) Ever-changing NICU staff  with different personalities  expectation  & comfort levels. 4) Tubes  wiring  monitors  etc. 5) Less-than-private NICU nursing environment. 6) Maintaining your supply... (See   Tips   for more) Even if your preemie can't nurse yet  ask the NICU staff about Kangaroo Care.  This allows for skin-to-skin time. Assuming your premie isn't too fragile  the warm touch of a parent is healthy for his emotional state  and Kangaroo Care promotes infant-parent bonding.  It can also serve as a source of encouragment and re-invigoration for parents amidst the often stressful NICU experience. Even if you can't put your baby to the breast  and even if your baby is taking only a small amount of milk  pumping will help maintain your supply  and it may give you some milk to spare.  Freeze any extra milk for future use. If your premie has trouble latching  practice latching after pumping.  Often times  it's easier for a baby to latch when the breast is not as full.  Eventually  your baby will figure out how to latch on even when you're full. Practice latching when your premie is NOT hungry  ie. AFTER a feeding.  Latching is a learned skill  and sometimes babies will show more patience--and will actually learn faster--if they're not so hungry. Remember to take care of yourself.  In order to produce adequate  rich milk  your body needs a lot of energy.  You just delivered a baby  and you're dealing with stress of having a baby in the NICU.  Make sure to eat a well-rounded  robust  and healthful diet  yourself. Being   scrunched   can make it harder coordinate sucking  swallowing  and breathing. The football hold allows your preemie's body to remain stretched out.  Using a pillow to support your premie can also help. This is what they do best. Out of the hospital  their services can cost upwards of $60 per hour  but in the hospital  it's included.  Utilize the hospital Lactation Consultants whenever possible. NICU nurses are some of the best you'll find. Highly dedicated & exceptionally well trained  they also have a lot invested in your premie. Still  they have different comfort levels & different personalities  good days and bad days. Show your appreciation for the nursing staff and Maintain a good rapport.  They can become your best NICU advocates and they'll help you reach your breastfeed goals.

218	Q:52434A:64567	What exactly is circumcision and why do they do it? Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin  a small flap of skin that covers the tip of the penis  generally performed in the days after birth. Examination of scientific studies between 1995 and now shows links between circumcision and decreased risks for urinary tract infections  some kinds of cancer  HPV  HIV  and other sexually transmitted diseases. There is a preventative effect. Mostly done in infancy because parents think it is cleaner and will avoid infections. May need to be done if foreskin is tight (phimosis) and doesn't retract easily & does not respond to steroid cream. Some adolescents want to look like the majority of other boys. It does prevent penile cancer which in itself is very rare and more likely caused by poor hygiene. Less smell. Some think looks better. The foreskin is a piece of skin that covers the glans  or the head of the penis. In  circumcision  this foreskin is removed. There is no medical necessity for this  but it is associated with a lower incidence of urinary tract infections  and penile cancer. Often it is done due to tradition or for religious reasons.

220	Q:52386A:143382	Is autism just a nice way to say retardation? Intelligence is very difficult to measure in even normal children.  It is nearly impossible to measure in children with autism.  If one uses IQ to predict school performance  autistic children would score low.  But if given special programs and appropriate testing  they can score very high.  Good example is Temple Grandin.  Read her books.  You will never ask such a question again. Intellectual Disability  the diagnosis that replaced Mental Retardation  is defined as having cognitive & social/adaptive abilities significantly below average. Autistic Disorder is having qualitative impairments in social reciprocity & social communication + narrow  restricted areas of interests &/or repetitive non-functional movements.40-65% of children with AD also have Intellectual Disability. in fact  many patients with autism have above average intelligence (IQ's greater than 100).  Patients with retardation  by definition  have IQ's less than 70 Autism and mental retardation (MR) are distinct diagnoses with clear definitions.  However  many individuals have both; and studies have shown that  these days  many families prefer a diagnosis of autism to that of MR.  Autism can have full range of intelligence of mentally retarded to genius level; MR means that the person is functioning at a much lower mental age than their actual age.

227	Q:16019A:17742	What is meconium? Meconium is when the baby has a bowel movement while still inside the uterus. It is more common in pregnancies that go beyond the due date. In most cases it does not cause problems but it can be a sign of a baby in distress. In some cases  the baby inhales it which causes meconium aspiration syndrome. Sometimes if the fetus is under stress it can have a bowel movement inside the uterus.  This is called meconium. When the baby is under stress in the last month of your pregnancy  he can poop in the amniotic fluid.  If you break your bag of waters before labor  and see greenish/greyish fluid  go on in to the hospital or your doctor's office and have them check to see if it's meconium.  As long as you're in the hospital for delivery  there's no worry.  The nurses or doctors will check the baby at birth. The very first stools a baby has are not like anything you have seen before if you haven't seen a newborn's first poop.  This very different stool is called meconium.  It is usually very dark greenish-black  very thick and slimy.  It tends to stick to your baby's butt  and is sometimes challenging to even wipe off.  But within a day or two  the poop changes to normal newborn stools. As a fetus grows  its organs and systems mature in preparation for functioning after birth. One such system is the gastrointestinal GI system. A fetus swallows amniotic fluid and its contents through pregnancy  and the   end   product literally is meconium  a dark green slimey substance. If baby's near term  it might pass a little and be OK. If early or stressed  it could breath it in and need help.

248	Q:38031A:27405	Is weightlifting okay for kids? The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against 'competitive' weight lifting for children. However  with proper training  supervision  and technique  weight lifting is safer than many other sports in which teenagers regularly participate. It can build self-esteem & serve as a healthy outlet  but YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILD IS HOLDING SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. Without proper equipment  training  and supervision  weight-lifting can lead to academic decline; unhealthy fad diets; drug and steroid abuse; crush injuries; overuse injuries; physical fights; and even heart damage. SUPERVISION BY AN EXPERIENCED ADULT is imperative. All weight lifting needs to be supervised so that the correct technique is used.  This will reduce the risk of injury.

274	Q:175331A:254435	What causes PMS in a girl? PMS may result from alterations in or interactions between the levels of sex hormones on brain chemistry. It signals failure to become pregnant. The mood swings may be evolutionary - a woman has only a fixed number of cycles to become pregnant before reaching infertility at menopause. PMS suggests reassessment. Do I need a new mate? Am I eating right? Am I ok? Fair or not  it ensures survival. Most girls with PMS have a relative progesterone deficiency in the second half of the cycle.  Vitamin deficiencies are also thought to be causative.  I get the best response with progesterone the last two weeks prior to menstrual bleeding.

Don't marry someone with a family history of autism  avoid exposure to alcohol & tobacco (first  secondhand & third hand) during pregnancy  don't use drugs.  The percipitants for autism are not entirely known  other than avoiding toxins during pregnancy. Since autism has no known cause  there is no known prevention.  Specifically  avoiding vaccines will NOT prevent vaccination.  Avoiding vaccines merely increases your risk of dying from communicable illness. Yours is the million $ question with no answer. Family history and environment play their roles  but there is no easy checklist of things to do and avoid. If there is a strong family history of Autism Spectrum in your or your partner's family  your chances would be higher  so some people choose to adopt in those cases.

290	Q:1243A:24318	How is Measles treated? Measles is a viral disease  so no antibiotics are effective. Anti viral drugs do not appear to work. Hydration and controlling the temperature are mainstays. Pneumonia and encephalitis require more intense measures such as  ventilator to assist breathing.The best treatment is prevention thru imunization. Get a measles vaccination series. Measles has no cure. Once someone has it  you can only ride it out. Keeping the fever down improves comfort and fluid intake. Acetaminophen can be helpful here. The best approach to measles is prevention by vaccine. Though we think of measles as generally harmless  it causes blindness  deafness  brain injury and death in thousands every year...still. Remember  Helen Keller was a victim of measles. Prevention is the best cure: immunization against measles is available and recommended. To treat  supportive care with fluids  respiratory support as needed  antipyretics  a calm environment avoiding bright lights  etc. Vitamin A supplementation is indicated in some individuals 6 mo to 2 yrs of age. Ribavirin and interferon are emerging therapies which have not yet been proven effective. Measles is an infection caused by a virus  so there are no effective medicines to treat measles. Treatment is aimed at the symptoms: treat the fever with fever reducers  treat the dehydration with IV fluids  treat the lungs with oxygen or a respirator machine if needed.  Measles is a devastating  possibly fatal disease.  The best treatment is prevention: get the measles vaccine for your baby. There is no treatment for measles.  Measles is a very contagious  very bad disease.  So  children need to be vaccinated to avoid getting measles.  In some severe cases  a drug called ribavirin has been tried  to help fight the measles virus. Once you have a case of the measles  it has to run its course. Measles is a highly contagious viral illness with a high rate of medical complications. It can be PREVENTED with vaccination  which I would highly recommend. There is no specific treatment for measles.  Acetaminophen  rest  and humidified air may help.  Measles causes rash  runny nose  red eyes  fever  and rarely  pneumonia  seizures  and death.  It is being seen more often  as parents delay or forgo the measles vaccine in their children  and especially in travelers abroad.  The vaccine to prevent measles is given at 12-15 months and 4-6 years. Unfortunately  measels is a viral infection that has no specific treatment. Alleviating the symptoms until the child's immune system fights the virus is the best treatment. Fever reducers  lots of fluids to avoid dehydration  saline & humidified air to alleviate cold symptoms is also helpful. Also watch for any signs of secondary infection (such as pneumonia or encephalitis- a brain infection). Measles is a viral illness easily preventible with vaccination. There has been an increase in the number of cases of measles in the U.S. among children who are not immunized with the MMR vaccine.  The symptoms of measles include fever  cough  head cold  pink eye  and a rash. Treatment is supportive with fever control and fluids  unless the child develops complications  like encephalitis. Measles is caused by a virus.  There is no specific medication for measles.  Most children with measles are miserable.  Fever & pain control with acetaminophen are typical.  Dehydration is a common complication which needs to be treated.  Measles is highly contagious you will want to keep your sick child away from others.  Prevention with vaccine is recommended.

294	Q:360A:21308	Is it ok to eat iron-fortified foods while breastfeeding? Women are much more prone to anemia. It is always a good idea to pay attention to the nutrients in our diets  specially with the added stressors of pregnacy and childbirth. No problem If it was ok for a Mom to eat iron-fortified foods before pregnancy  then it should be fine for her to eat iron-fortified foods while breastfeeding.  In regards to a baby  his iron-fortified foods are usually baby formula and baby cereals.  If a baby is older than about 6 months  he can eat iron-fortified baby cereals while breastfeeding. Yes. It is OK  and often encouraged for moms at risk for iron deficiency. Though breast milk contains low levels of iron  that iron is in a form that is much more likely to be absorbed and used by the baby. Thumbs up! Be advised that the nutrient content of breast milk remains remarkably constant  regardless of the mother's diet.  Mother's intake of extra iron will not increase the amount of iron in her breast milk. It is great to eat a diet rich in iron while breastfeeding. Making sure you do not become iron-deficient is very important to prevent your baby from developing iron. If your doctor has prescribed you an iron supplement for anemia  that is very safe to do as well. Definitely  it is encouraged. During breastfeeding  your baby takes all sort of nutrition out of you body and iron is one of them.  To keep your iron stores good for your baby and breastfeeding  it is good to eat iron fortified foods.

295	Q:38760A:154137	Is it normal for kids with ADHD to be shy? Kids with ADHD do not consistently present as being shy. However  they are often awkward in social situations  and this is the most common reason for their interpersonal difficulties. ADHD is also associated with impulsive behavior which can relate to being a class clown.  There can be comorbid behaviors such as OCD or anxiety disorders  not specifically related to ADHD   that can interfere with socialization. it depends on the individual child ADHD kids are often in trouble and have low self esteems. They may be awkward as they are over active much of the time. So  these factors may associate with shyness. type & presence of learning disabilities. Shyness is a personsality trait often noted in kids who had a    slow-to-warm-up    temperament in infancy  &  in some kids who recognize (amazingly early on) that they're not able to converse  behave  or perform  academically at the level of their peers. A few parents still come in saying    I don't want him/her to know he/she has a problem.   'Nuff said They may be shy in circumstances you would have guessed they would not be  and overly gregarious  friendly  when you would have guessed they would not be. Often they have more problems with peers nearly the same age but not with kids 2+ years younger than they are  and they may relate to strangers better than to people they know well. In children and adults with ADHD  some of the most common co-occurring disorders are anxiety disorders.  The reasons for that are many  including genetics and a tendency for some people with ADHD to be shy because of how they feel bad about the effect of their illness on their friendships and school/work They have trouble keeping track of information about people - starting with their names - and live in fear of embarrassment at mixing that up.Some deal with it by becoming clowns  and turn these mistakes into pratfalls and jokes. If a kid has Inattentive type ADHD  then shyness would be a more common personality trait. However  if a kid has Hyperactive type or combined ADHD then the behaviour tends to be more outgoing often excessively. Impulse control with procrastination always seem to be common traits as well. Some children with ADHD also have trouble with social cues. They don't always pick up on either the friendly encouragements or the   you're in my personal space   signs from others. They may feel that other kids don't like them. They can learn how to read social cues  though  through role-playing and socialization therapy.

296	Q:61828A:161726	My daughter is 12  5ft 4 and weigjhd 90pds is this healthy? While her Height to weight ration (body mass index of BMI) is within the normal range what is really important is if she is still on her normal growth curve. Ask your pediatrician because they should have this information for you. If your daughter is falling off her curve there is reason for concern. If she is still on her curve then it is just the way she is and she is OK if otherwise healthy. Given her weight  height  and body mass index it seems she is tall and thin compared to others her age.  If she has always been tall and thin compared to peers and if she seems to take after someone in the family  I would not worry about her weight.  Just encourage her to eat healthy.  If she has had a recent drop in her weight  I would be concerned and take her in for further evaluation. At 12 years:your child is 90 pounds  and that is at the 45th percentile for weight. Your child is 64 inches  and that is at the 93rd percentile for height.  Her weight is perfect and her height is above average. That weight for height puts a 12 year old girl at the 10th percentile for body mass index. (BMI). BMIs between 5th and 85th percentile are considered   normal    but within that range  we would still worry over big changes. If a child is losing  or failing to gain weight  it can still be unhealthy. If she has always been thin but well  probably it's ok. If you have concerns  ask your pediatrician. she's taller than 75-90 %  12yo girls  and heavier than 25-50% of them. Whether that is   healthy   depends on how she takes care of herself  and how she was growing up until now. If she is built like other members of your family she's most likely fine. But if her weight was on the 75% and now is on the 25th  there's an issue.  Ease your mind: discuss her   growth chart   with her pediatrician.

It adults and older kids  it usually just causes a   common cold.   In infants  though  it can also cause wheezing and breathing problems which can sometimes be severe. Viral colds are the most common cause of bronchilitis in babies. Many viruses can be the culprit. RSV (respiratory syncitial virus) is a very common cause  especially in premature infants. Children under two years of age are most at risk and the younger the child  potentially the more severe the symptoms could be. could be rsv  hmpv  adenovirus  flu  paraflu  rhinovirus etc.watchhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Teb03hEIXw&feature=relatedto learn more Common cold  RSV  Wheezing  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Infection  Children  Virus  Breathing  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Children  Virus  Premature  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Child Health Common cold  RSV  Wheezing  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Infection  Children  Virus  Breathing  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Children  Virus  Premature  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Child Health Common cold  RSV  Wheezing  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Infection  Children  Virus  Breathing  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Baby  Children  Virus  Premature  Child Health RSV  Bronchiolitis  Child Health
307	Q:301402A:431943	What defines a micropenis? The definition is reasonably solid for newborn males and is based on streched penile length. However  for adult men  it is much less defined and is dependent upon the true penile length  the amount of prepubic fat  and its turgidity.  Many men mistakenly believe they have small penises because the penises the see in pornographic images are NOT typical of normal males. Otherwise normal in appearance & not  hypospadiac or epispadiac penises which are otherwise abnormal. Size definition is somwhat subjective  but  severely small compared to child's body size. Streched flaccid lenght (pushing down on pubic bone to tip of glans) should be more than 2.5cm in a term or 7 1/2 lb otherwise normal newborn. Below 2.5cm can be considered a micropenis.

311	Q:113217A:177699	What is amblyopia? The human brain utilized the input of both eyes to aid in depth perception/distance etc. As a child grows  their eyes may have different strength  or weakness in an eye muscle may allow one to line up wrong. The fuzzy or double vision confuses the brain. Over time the brain may begin turning off the input of one eye & keep the best. That process is called amblyopia. If caught early it can be fixed In children  when the nerve pathways between the eye and the brain are developing  there needs to be two clear images (one from each eye) for appropriate development of vision and depth perception.  If one image is abnormal (e.g. vision is blocked or blurred) or the eyes are misaligned producing double vision  then as a coping mechanism  the abnormal image will be suppressed and vision impaired.

315	Q:154677A:241966	What are the tests for neuroblastoma? If there is suspicion of the disease  there are urine test and imaging that can be done.  The object of these tests is to find a concerning mass.  Once a mass is identified  it must be biopsied or removed.  The ultimate diagnosis is made by a series of histological tests on the mass run by a pathologist.  Once NB is diagnosed  it will be staged with additional studies. Tests include blood tests and ct scan of abdomen and possibly chest. In about 90 % of children with neuroblastoma  the chemicals called VMA and/or HVA in urine are increased. Thus this can be used as a screening if one suspects neuroblastoma. But it does not detect 100 % of patients  thus normal urine VMA/HVA does not exclude the diagnosis of neuroblastoma. This is particularly true in newborn infants with neurobllastoma or children with neuroblastoma in the chest.

New studies in J Toxicol Environ Health  2011 & Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry  2011 did infer an association between Autism and vaccines > 30  known genetic syndromes include Autism and Intellectual Disability in their developmental profile + copy repeat errors are found on genetic microarray in ~15% of people with Autism. Epigenetic factors like certain viruses & drugs change the function  but not the structure of fetal genes . Environmental  factors  may trigger the expression of these altered genes  like illnessess with fever. Autism(A) and  similar disorders have stumped researchers for ages. Recently  multiple fine defects have been found on  micro array studies of the chromasomes of kids with A & ASD. This suggests misplaced genetic material may be involved very early in fetal life.This could suggest envirnomental toxins prior to or during pregnancy.More credible studies are needed & less attention to junk science. Autism is a large group of individuals with many different specific diagnoses. Only about 30% of children with autism can be found to have a specific gentic disorder. More of these will be discovered in the future. There have been no definitive studies linking autism and vaccines. Most physicians recommend that all chidren receive their vaccinations in a timely manner. More and more genetic links to autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD's) are being found; there's even genetic testing available for siblings of patients with ASD's to see if they have it  too.

358	Q:339442A:478714	I have amblyopia. How is it treated? Ambliopia is the process where the brain ignores the   camera   picture from one eye because it is less clear or causes double vision. It can sometimes be improved if the weaker eye is strengthened (glasses) the stronger eye is patched or if the eye is lined up better with surgery. If the process has gone on too long  the brain ignores the fix & surgery is simply cosmetic. It is treated with glasses  patching  and/or eye drops. It is not really treatable in adults.

360	Q:79096A:127547	at what degree shouldd I take my daughter to the hospitol by? Fevers to 103 are not uncommon in children and are not dangerous if a child otherwise looks well. That is if their color is normal  they are alert  and they are drinking.  However  any child with a fever who is very lethargic  has poor color  is not drinking should be seen quickly.  Rules are different for infants under 4 months old  if they have a fever of over 101 rectally  they need to be seen. If your child is under a month of age  she should be seen right away for 100.4 degree temp or higher. For older children  it is more important to watch the symptoms she has regardless of the height of the fever. If she is having labored breathing  seems excessivel irritable and conspirator  or unusuallynlethargic  or having signs of dehydration that is more urgent than the absolute temperature. MORE IMPORTANT: How is she acting?--is she lethargic ( weak  limp)  (sign of SERIOUS infection)--is she short of breath? (sign of pneumonia)--is she in pain (sign of appendicitis ...)--is she vomiting (getting dehydrated)THESE are what we are looking for NOT the height of a feverA lethargic child with a 101 temp is MORE serious than a child still playing with 103 temp.

The main symptoms of myotonic dystrophy (i.e.  weakness and muscle wasting) may worsen during pregnancy  and they may interfere with proper progress of labor  sometimes presenting serious problems. There have been reports of muscle wasting in affected fetuses  and newborns likewise should be followed closely for the possible development of congenital myotonic dystrophy. Women with MD will typically have worsening of symptoms and may develop difficulty with walking or breathing. There is an increased risk of miscarriage  problems with labor  anesthetic and postpartum bleeding.

Swaddeling is fine for a while & babies seldom reject it yet a gradual lostening of the wrap over time allows baby to begin enjoying the world they entered.Many babies are bothered by the shaky random movements of their limbs early on & wrapping stops that  yet when are they allowed to be free? I'm for allowing baby as much freedom as they can tolerate and still rest. I am a huge proponent of swaddling newborns  they love it. Perfecting a snug swaddle  one where your baby cannot shake free  will prove beneficial for both you and your baby. Not only do babies love that snug feeling  like they were inside your womb  but they are less likely to startle themselves awake. Large swaddle blankets work best for a snug burrito wrap.

401	Q:52502A:64618	What are the benefits of circumcision? Analysis of all the available research data by the American Academy of Pediatrics demostrated a benefit of doing it versus the detriment of the risk. The benefit was described as   small    but this does mean there is an advantage to performing it than the risk of not. Circ rates run 0-80% depending on cultural religious& healthcare practices around the world. The only males with UTI's I've treated in 3 decades were uncircumcised & often <2mo old. You'll never have a trapped glans(paraphimosis) or cancer of the removed area. In the end  its more cultural than need.I view it similar to piercing ears but with a few potential health benefits. Less risk of urinary infections in first 6 - 12 months of life  which are quite uncommon anyway. Worth doing in boys with urinary tract abnormalities such as urethral valves  bladder reflux or hydronephrosis. Much cleaner for men who do not wash. Is a cure for phimosis (tight foreskin).  Prevents the all too rare cancer of penis. Significant reduction in HIV &HPV transmission (Studies from Africa) There are no true benefits of circumcision. Old beliefs that circumcision may confer better care of the penis have not been substantiated  as most males do well being uncircumcised. As far as STD  including HIV prevention  the benefit of circumcision as a preventative measure is highly debatable.

406	Q:242243A:373144	Is adhd an actual excuse for a lot of misbehaved children? ADHD is a real disorder. There is a biological reason that children develop ADHD. Children with true ADHD cannot control their behavior. Often times  they want to  but they cannot. Medications and behavioral therapy can work wonders in children with ADHD. That being said  I have seen parents in practice that have difficulty setting boundaries  rules  and consequences for their kids so they misbehv ADHD is the best-studied psychiatric disorder in chidlren; types of impairment  including   misbehavior   are well documented  as are treatment options.  That does not mean that all children who misbehave have ADHD.  Many do not.  Chronic misbehavior  however  is a problem that needs assessment and intervention  whatever the cause. ADHD is an inherited neurobiologic disorder affecting frontal lobe function worsened by intrauterine neurotrauma/alcohol/ nicotine exposure. MRI studies have shown it to exist.

422	Q:78232A:125738	What sort of disorder is epiglottitis? usually caused by a bacteria called H. Flu (not influenza).  now only seen in unimmunized children.  and is very serious and deadly. Inflammation of the epiglottis  a small piece of cartilage  at the opening of the larynx  usually caused by infection. Swelling  can cause sudden and life-threatening obstruction of the airway. Manipulation of the airway needs to be done by the most experienced person  with a surgeon present. Thankfully less common now due to the H flu vaccine. Epiglottitis is any inflammation of the epiglottis (a mucus membrane covered triangular cartilage that covers the opening to the airway  or glottis).  This was deadly in children when it was caused by a bacterium  Haemophilus Influenzae  prior to the vaccination age  but can still occur due to irritation  viruses  exotic bacteria  and in immunocompromised people. The epiglottis is the flap of tissue that covers your windpipe to keep food out of lungs. If it gets infected  the swelling blocks breathing and swallowing and is very dangerous. The haemophilus influenzae vaccine has made it rare  but other bacteria can cause. Intubation is very important  but dangerous. If not possible  may require tracheotomy until antibiotics reduce swelling. Epiglotittis is an acute infection of the epiglottis   which is a soft tissue that hangs in front of your windpipe opening.  This is a very serious illness as if not treated quickly can lead to severe respiratory difficulties.  If symptoms of  severe sore throat   excessive salivation  difficulty breathing or swallowing  and fever occur  go to an emergency room or your doctor immediately.

426	Q:184149A:278598	what is an epiglottitis spasm? Epiglottitis occurs when an infection by a bacteria called Hemophilus Influenza   type B  causes severe swelling of the epiglottis  with the potential for obstructing the airway just below it. The   spasm   is actually of the  muscles associated with the vocal cords  and this is known as laryngeal spasm or laryngospasm. The epiglottis itself does not spasm. Normally your epiglottis (EG) covers your airway when you swallow food or liquids.This prevents stuff from entering your lungs & causing pneumonia. If a child has an infected EG  they usually sit up & try not to swallow their own spit. They often sound hoarse & look afraid. If you make the mistake (parent or MD) of forcing them to lay down  the EG can spasm shut & breathing can be impossible.

However  a nanny could be here on a work visa  or an Au Pair from another country looking for an experience here in the United States. The essential thing is that they should be here legally to avoid future trouble. However  you need to make sure that your nanny is somebody you trust to leave children with.

429	Q:180788A:720511	How do you heal keratoconus? Intacs helps improve vision. People with keratoconus  because of their weak and falling cornea are not seeing to the appropriate window. Meaning that when the intac is inserted it lifts up the cornea. Your specialist should monitor your cornea thickness to see if it may be progressing. And depending  cross linking may be necessary. This can only be treated at the moment. There is no cure for keratoconus. The cornea becomes weaker and changes shape over time. A new treatment called corneal crosslinking is being investigated in the US to strengthen the cornea and slow progression of the disease. crosslinking is the only procedure that stops the progression of keratoconus.  Once treated  the next step is to improve vision with contact lenses.

I have had some moms report good success with simple hand held steamers. Sold as a house cleaning tool this simple device pushes out steam under pressure that can blast off dirt & debris from fabric  metal or plastic & dry off almost immediately. It sanitizes as it cleans without leaving any toxic film behind. While you don't want a child's stroller to be a pigsty  keep in mind that kids' immune systems grow and mature as they are exposed to their environment. There is a growing body of research suggesting that raising kids in too clean an environment can set them up for asthma and other immune-related diseases down the road. So clean it but don't sweat it too much. Most modern strollers have the ability to remove the fabric components and easily put them in the washing machine; refer to the instruction manual  or contact the manufacturer for additional information.  If not use a wet  soapy washcloth using whichever baby soap you utilize for your 'passenger' and just wipe it down.

That is vision which cannot even be corrected with glasses  soft contact lenses and in some cases even with hard lenses.Also it induces rubbing Blurred vision  reduced vision; often the need for contact lenses to see.  The good news is that corneal collagen crosslinking  can stop the progression of keratoconus - and can often even improve quality of vision. The weak corneal collagen allows the cornea to gradually take on an abnormal shape  which interferes with vision. At first this resembles ordinary astigmatism and glasses will help. As the condition progresses  the cornea becomes more irregular shape producing irregular astigmatism requiring a RGP contact lens for best vision or a corneal transplant.

Here is Dr. Barcott who does these early evals.   http://youtu.be/YcLCPO-SIIs Most recent published data 1/88 kids 1/254 girls 1/54 boys By definition  symptoms of Autism appear before age 3. Some toddlers with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders or with mood/behavior problems & strong family history of Bipolar Disorder exhibit autistic behaviors at that age that do not persist.I've also seen older children previously diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome who actually have primary mental illness. Monitoring development over time is key. The facts are that autism diagnosis is up 78 percent from 2002 and 23 percent from 2006 - a very big deal. However  lets think about whether this is because we can detect more kids with autism or whether more illness exists today.

467	Q:111552A:285105	Are clipboards at pediatrics offices germy? not cleaned every day.  Truly  everything is   germy   as germs live on everything at all times.  This means milliseconds after you wash your hands  germs are already on them again.  The reason you wash your hands it to eliminate any   bad   germs that can cause infection. A clipboard in a doctor's office is more likely to have bad germs as there is a higher percentage of sick people there. I have staff clean pens and boards but use your Purcell after. Same with pharmacy pens And we provide alcohol cleansers for use between patients and their parents.  Bring your own is my best advice. Anything that multiple people touch without washing their hands has the potential to be   germy  .  Unfortunately  that goes for many things in our society-doorknobs  clipboards  keyboards  etc.  In our pediatric practice  and I would expect the same goes for many practices  the clipboards are routinely wiped down with a sanitizer. If you are worried about the clipboards  I certainly would not tough the door knobs.NO i would not worry about the clip boards.Hopefully they are cleaned on ocassion but even so not likely to be a source of concern. Most everything has some exposure unless thoroughly cleaned between each exposure. Everything someone touches in public has germs on them.  Most infections are acquired by touching your face (especially nose  mouth eyes) without sanitizing your hands. Hence the best way to prevent acquiring infections from touching a clipboard or a cereal box in the grocery aisle is to wash your hands before touching your face. Good disinfectants are Purell type products or soap and water. Almost everything in the Pediatric office carries germs  including books  toys and even the doctor's stethoscope.  Most offices try to clean these items but it would be very difficult to clean everything between each patient.  Hand washing is a good idea when you leave using soap and water or hand sanitizer which should be available in each room.

476	Q:1829A:1271692	What is Thalassemia? Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an unusual type of hemoglobin  the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen. The condition causes heavy destruction of red blood cells  which leads to anemia or a low blood count.  There are twon main types based on which chain is affected - alpha or beta. Thalassemia is an inability to make one of the two chains that make up hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin is the major component of red blood cells and is the part of the clls responsible for carying oxygen throught the body. Thalassemia is a genetically inherited deficiency in one of the types of proteins that make up hemoglobin  the substance that carries iron and binds to oxygen in the bloodstream. Deficiencies in these proteins - most commonly the alpha or beta sub-types - results in less functional hemoglobin in the body  and less ability to carry oxygen in some cases. Talk to your provider for more info. Thalassemia runs in families.  It is caused by variations (mutations) in DNA  which is then passed on to future generations.  There are many variations in the DNA (genes) that code for hemoglobin molecules inside red blood cells.  Some of these variations cause the hemoglobin production to be very slow  so blood cells stay too small because they can't get enough hemoglobin to grow to normal size. Thalassemia is a deficiency in the production of one of the globin chains (alpha or beta) that make up hemoglobin. Normally synthesis of these is balanced. when imbalanced  one globin accumulates relative to the other forming inclusions that are damaging to the red cells that contain them. There are many thal variants that manifest a wide severity of symptoms from none to transfusion dependence.

Compulsive sexual activity is often a form of addiction which has combined biological and psychological roots. Your children may inherit biologically an decreased capacity to sooth themselves in other ways. Because you don't have this capacity you may find it hard to teach it to your children  and so pass it on psychologically. There are a number of addictions that have tendencies to be inherited in varying degrees. There is no evidence that sexual addiction is one of them. That said  the presence of addicted individuals in a family does suggest others there are at risk of becoming addicted.

492	Q:1804A:127804	What are the symptoms of Autism? Early signs of autism are no social smile at six months  lack of gesturing and pointing by 12 months  poor eye contact  lack of pretend play by 18 months  it is a social and communication disorder  and we pediatricians are looking for these developmental milestones carefully during checkups! the hallmarks are speech delay  decreased social interactions  limited areas of interest  limited imaginative play and certain stereotypical movements like hand flapping. Autism is a communication disorder that impairs language and social developement. When a baby is not meeting developemental milestones  does not seem to react socially with smiling  showing pleasure and recognition when seeing a parent  not showing affection  and not clearly recognizing his/her name by a year of age   Autism might be suspected and referral to a specialist is warranted. The three key features of autism are 1) delay in language development  2) poor social interactions  and 3) obsessional or repetitive behaviors. New screening tests are used by medical providers to screen for these features starting at 18months old  and there are some studies on tests to detect autism even earlier. As always  if you have a concern  it's best to see your provider. Children with autism typically have difficulty communicating with others in a socially appropriate and effective manner. Some may be severely speech delayed. Others may be able to talk but may lack the appropriate social skills to maintain a normal conversation and interact with others. Autistic children may also have difficulty sustaining eye contact & playing with others/toys in a typical manner Autism is not a disease It is a disorder and as such the symptoms could vary in severity and presentation.Diagnostic criteria includes impairement in social skills language/communication and a rigid behavior.If your child exhibits a behavior that appears odd or different to you seek help early.Pediatricians routinely should screen at well visits.A standarized screener such as the Mchat is a valid Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Eye contact  Eye  Child Health Hand flapping  Hand  Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Baby  Not showing  Parenting  Child Health Autism  Language development  Autism spectrum disorder  Child development  Repetitive behaviors  Screening  Child Health Autism  Toys  Autism spectrum disorder  Eye contact  Eye  Children  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Eye contact  Eye  Child Health Hand flapping  Hand  Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Baby  Not showing  Parenting  Child Health Autism  Language development  Autism spectrum disorder  Child development  Repetitive behaviors  Screening  Child Health Autism  Toys  Autism spectrum disorder  Eye contact  Eye  Children  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Eye contact  Eye  Child Health Hand flapping  Hand  Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Baby  Not showing  Parenting  Child Health Autism  Language development  Autism spectrum disorder  Child development  Repetitive behaviors  Screening  Child Health Autism  Toys  Autism spectrum disorder  Eye contact  Eye  Children  Child Health Autism  Autism spectrum disorder  Child Health

498	Q:5892A:8	My newborn hasn't pooped at all today.  What should I do? If it's within the first few weeks of life  stool output is one way to tell if baby's getting enough to eat-- so you'd want to think about if nursing is going well  and you may need to contact your pediatrician to go through more-specific questions. Past 2 weeks or so  many breast-fed babies who are nursing great and gaining weight well will start to go longer without stool  and it can be normal. Again  the question is better answered knowing how old is the infant. If indeed a newborn  it should be having more then one stool per day. However  it is still common for child who are breastfed to go multiple days without stool. Is child having distended belly  less food intake or vomiting - these would be concerning for GI issues. Please see your pediatrician if concerned. Many newborns have infrequent bowel movements.  As long as your infant is feeding well  urinating frequently and seems comfortable  you can wait and watch to see what happens.  If your infant doesn't have a bowel movement for more than 72 hours or is irritable  feeding poorly or not having wet diapers  you should call your pediatrician. Poops can happen after every feeding  but they can also happen every few days (up to 10 in a breast fed child)  and frequency can change at random.  The child's mood  appetite  weight gain  urine output  and other factors are more important than poop frequency in determining the level of concern.

These typically begin in the newborn period and are often due to traces of cow's milk or soy present in breast milk. In proctocolitis the infant passes stool with streaks of red blood. In FPIES vomiting & diarrhea begin 1-2 hours after feeding & may be accompanied by prostration and shock.

515	Q:20393A:55420	What is included in an IVIg infusion? IgA is usually found in most IVIG preparations  therefore subjects with selective IgA deficiency are contraindicated to receive this form of IVIG due to the risk of anaphylaxis. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a collection of IgG antibodies pooled from the plasma of over 1000 blood donors. Extensive processing to remove other antibodies and possible contaminants makes IVIG expensive. The solution that the antibodies are dissolved in sometimes is high in sugar & should be given carefully to diabetics. Most brands also have preservatives in the product.

516	Q:527177A:793567	What does ER do if a patient with heart disease and tachycardia has anaphylaxis shock? Do they still give epinephrine injection? Tachycardia is frequently caused by anaphylaxis. The only drug that truly treats the condition is epinephrine. Therefore  the drug should still be used in patients with heart disease. However  a good way of reducing the danger from the medication is to give lower initial doses  e.g. a pediatric dose of 0.15mg IM  which can be repeated every 10 minutes as necessary.

517	Q:20173A:734097	Are there any serious potential complications of urticaria and angioedema? Angioedema (AE) of the tongue may compromise breathing. AE in the absence of hives may be a symptom of C1 esterase deficiency. In this disease AE of the windpipe can lead to suffocation while AE of the gut can lead to severe pain & unnecessary surgery. Hives & AE may be symptoms of anaphylaxis a life-threatening allergic problem involving breathing  heart and digestive systems. Urticaria or hives can be very distressing and itchy  but not associated with complications unless there is vasculitis called urticarial vasculitis.  Angioedema associated with hives is also uncomfortable but not necessarily dangerous unless it affects the tongue or throat.  Hereditary angioedema where there is no hives can be life threatening due to throat swelling and asphyxiation.

Non ionic CT contrast has a very low risk of anaphylaxis without premedication. You have no history of contrast allergy so there is no clear cut indication for premedication. However  your history of asthma and anxiety about the procedure may increase your susceptibility and should be addressed. It is reasonable to ask your doctor for a mild sedative like valium before the test. No harm in premedication steroid/benadryl if your doctor prescribes it too. Risk remains small.

522	Q:889085A:1275513	What if someone has anaphylaxis and they are allergic to epinephrine? Also  is it possible to be epinephrine resistant? You cannot be allergic to epinephrine.  That is impossible.  Your body makes epinephrine naturally and it is necessary to survive.  You cannot be epinephrine resistant.  When you are given a shot of epinephrine  it last between 2 and 5 minutes max.  So  it will wear off.  The point in anaphylaxis is to stop the allergic cascade that happens. I know of no one who is allergic to epinephrine even though you may get shaking or rapid heart beats from it.  However I would take the side effects anytime if I have an anaphylactic reaction.   If the anaphylaxis is severe and the treatment is delayed  you may not respond to epinephrine alone and IV fluid may well be needed.

547	Q:1752A:1602	Is it safe for my baby to get a flu shot? Flu vaccine is one of the safest and best tolerated immunizations.  There are many misbeliefs about it.  One is that the flu shot can give you the flu.  This is absolutely incorrect.  In fact it is really quite impossible for the flu shot to give you the flu since it is a killed virus vaccine.  The only clear reason to avoid flu vaccination is a history of anaphylaxis (severe allergy) to egg. Yes  it is. The only current exception is if the patient has had a documented SEVERE allergy to eggs.  Even in such cases  it is probably safe to give the vaccine  which may be split in two doses on two separate visits. If your baby is older than 6 mos of age and has no immuniocompromizing condition  it is a lot safer to be immunized than to get influenza infection Unless your baby has a severe egg allergy or an illness that compromises her immune system  the flu shot is safe for kids 6 months and older.  It's also a good idea for everyone else in the house to get the flu shot too (especially if mom is breastfeeding - then mom's flu shot further helps protect baby). Flu shots are recommended for everyone over 6 months of age.

Its referred to as alpha-gal allergy  occurs about 4 hours after a meal  and curiously develops after the bite of the lone star tick or the red chigger. This allergic reaction is to a small carbohydrate  alpha galactose  and not as usually seen  to a protein. Most of these reactions have been reported in the South & in Australia Anaphylaxis is a life threatening allergy reaction that occurs within minutes to hours of being exposed to the allergen in question. Very rarely one can see anaphylaxis that is delayed and not occur for a couple of hours after exposure. More commonly one sees anaphylaxis that occurs immediately then the symptoms recur hours later -- this is called a biphasic response.

Caffeine is a small molecule that rarely  if ever  causes anaphylaxis. Like any other possible allergen a skin test is performed. If history is convincing & test positive no further testing is required. Otherwise a blinded challenge is done in the office. Caffeine allergy is unusual but has been reported in the literature. After speaking to your allergist and clarifying your history  there are several options that could be explored. Skin testing could be done but there is no standardized skin test reagents for caffeine thus the results must be interpreted with care.

560	Q:108587A:172385	How long after one bee sting can anaphylaxis still occur  after the initial bee sting? Anaphylaxis is characterized by a defined exposure to a potential trigger  followed by rapid onset  evolution  and resolution of symptoms and signs within minutes to hours. There is a biphasic form involving a recurrence of symptoms 8-10 hours after the apparent resolution of the initial episode with no further exposure to the trigger. Protracted form can last for hours  days  or weeks. True anaphylaxis is a fairly rapid event but can evolve over time and become more serious.  In younger children abdominal pain and nausea are actually fairly common and more serious as internal organ failure can occur with this condition.  If you have a first time reaction to a sting beyond a local reaction  that involves a personal sense of doom  dizziness  or confusion get help right away! You typically have severe allergic reactions to bee stings within a few minutes of exposure but you could have a reaction a few hours after the event. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition and needs emergency treatment and evaluation by an allergist. The so called biphasic anaphylaxis is where the symptoms recur after having been treated initially. So the patient is treated appropriately initially  but the anaphylaxis comes back. Biphasic anaphylaxis is more common if the initial therapy is delayed or if the initial presentation is more severe. For this reason the patient may be observed in the ER for 4 hours in some cases.

566	Q:231325A:332501	Is it possible to know if you are allergic to a bee before you get stung? You have to be stung at least once to develop an allergic reaction to bee stings. About 17% of persons who have ever been stung have allergy antibodies to bee stings. Only 1% of stung persons develop life-threatening anaphylaxis. So even the presence of allergy antibodies doesn't predict the risk of a future severe allergic reaction to bee sting very well.

570	Q:50475A:52687	What is the overall approach to patients with allergies and asthma? The general approach to patients with allergies and asthma is to treat both.  Allergies should be identified and treated (if possible)  if that is not possible a leukotriene agonist is a reasonable adjunct.  Additionally  any symptoms should be addressed - rhinorhea from allergies should be treated with nasal steroids and saline washes (+/- claritin)  and asthma should be controlled with (comment Treatment of allergies and asthma includes avoiding the triggers responsible for the reactions as much as possible. Other treatments aim at relieving symptoms like bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory meds like steroids. 1.AVOIDANCE One should avoid things to which you are allergic. Also avoid irritants like cigarette smoke and air pollution. 2. MEDICATION Medications control inflammation and symptoms  but do not cure. It is important to take medications regularly. 3.

That is why some airlines quit serving peanuts because the circulating peanut dust can cause a reaction.  Foods now also carry a warning that they are manufactured in plants where peanuts  or nuts  or other food allergens  are also produced. Depending on how allergic a person is to a food even a tiny bite can cause anaphylaxis.

Sadly most deaths from anaphylaxis occur in victims who knew exactly what was happening but did not have their EpiPen with them  It was either left behind at home or at the hotel or in the car while they were at a restaurant. In most instances symptoms of anaphylaxis develop in just a few minutes. Your EpiPen is worthless if its not within easy reach. Absolutely! Although anaphylaxis is not necessarily resolved with injectable epinephrine it is the only treatment that will hopefully give you time to get to Emergency Care.

583	Q:182205A:259557	Will my 4 yr old daughter likely be allergic to bee stings if her mother has anaphylaxis to bee stings? She gets a rash with amoxil. There is no guarantee that she will develop the same allergy as her mother  and the rash with amoxicillin also does not suggest what  if anything else  she is allergic to. The best advice would be to see your physician who can perform either RAST testing (blood test) or skin prick testing while keeping the mothers history in mind. No your daughter is not more likely to have a severe allergic reaction to bee stings. There is rash associated with amoxicillin called the amoxicillin rash. It is a rough or bumpy rash sometimes described as feeling like sand paper. It is not an allergic reaction to amoxicillin. If daughter rash to amoxicillin was of this type she is not likely allergic to amoxicillin. There is a very weak relationship between a family member having bee sting allergy & increased risk for other family members. If your daughter has not had an anaphylactic reaction to bee stings she needs neither skin nor blood testing nor an EpiPen Junior. She should be tested only if she has had hives  difficulty breathing  or passing out after a bee  hornet or wasp sting.

595	Q:67499A:95211	If you are allergic to bees do you need to carry an epipen? The first point is to define allergy and to detemine what insect may be the offending agent.  Allergic reactions require symptoms distant to the sting site.  A large local swelling is not enough.  Hives  generalized swelling  wheezing or other breathing or circulatory problems suggest true allergy.  Knowing the circumstance of the sting can help identify the insect.  Diagnosis can be confirmed. If you had more than mild sneezing  wheezing  and/or hives from you last beesting  you'd do well to get an epinephrine needle.  Better safe than sorry. It depends on the reaction you have to a bee sting.  If your throat starts to swell and it becomes difficult to breath; I would definitely recommend carrying an epi-pen. Additionally it is important to see an allergist to be tested.  Venom immunotherapy  is highly  successful in reducing the chances of repeat reactions including anaphylaxis.

600	Q:88174A:143750	What is anaphylaxis? Why is it such a big deal? Anaphylaxis is a true medical emergency that if left untreated  and sometimes if treated appropriately  can lead to the death of the patient in the most severe cases. Anaphylaxis = medical emergency in which your immune system responds too vigorously to an allergen.  Allergen could be ingested  injected  breathed in or in severe cases just contact skin.  Vigorous response causes variety of symptoms including marked swelling  constriction of airways  dilation of peripheral vessels  itching. Result is inability to breathe and pump blood - very bad very quickly. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction affecting many organs at once. Most serious is swelling shutting off movement of air through the windpipe & leakage of plasma out of the bloodstream leading to catastrophic loss of blood pressure  shock & heart stoppage. Death occurs in 1% of all episodes of anaphylaxis. Its victims are often children and young adults in the prime of life.

601	Q:20424A:30114	How do doctors diagnose milk allergies? The first part of milk allergy diagnosis is noting what happens when milk or dairy is ingested.  Testing can be done by an allergist with a skin test or through a blood test called Immunocap checking for specific IgE antibody to milk.  Both are good tests.   Before going to the doctor  one can eliminate milk/dairy and see if the symptoms resolve.  That would be helpful evidence as well. Milk allergy usually begins in infancy. Most children have skin or GI issues (pain and diarrhea).  Less common are nasal and chest symptoms or anaphylaxis. The diagnosis is made by skin test (by an allergist) or by measuring specific IgE (blood test). Many infants  older children and adults are intolerant to milk in which case these tests would be negative.  Other types of milk allergy do exist.

606	Q:88113A:145504	Are there home remedies for anaphylaxis? If you have epinephrine at home.....  In all seriousness  it depends on the trigger.  Avoidance is the mainstay for food or drug induced anaphylaxis.  Bee sting induced anaphylaxis can be prevented by desensitizations.  Regular medications  H1 and H2 antihistamines  can help prevent reactions due to unclear causes. The ONLY home remedy for an anaphylactic reaction is to immediately call 9-1-1. If an Epi-pen is available  give it and then call 9-1-1. Under no circumstances is there any other   home   remedy.

Unfounded fears are best treated through therapy/counseling.  Tongues can swell  but usually as a result of an allergic reaction or medical condition.  It sounds like your major issue is the fear of it happening  in spite of no supporting evidence that you are at risk.  I would associate it with your history of anxiety and panic attacks.  Let your therapist know what you are feeling! Fears are primarily irrational concerns about things that may or may not happen. It is impossible to predict if you will ever have an allergy or an injury or a syndrome that may validate your fears. I would seek a consultation with a therapist to help you understand and control the irrational thoughts. Worrying about it WILL NOT change any outcome.

628	Q:128753A:316871	How can food allergies be so life-threatening? Food allergies can cause anaphylaxis which can kill. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can cause itchiness  hives  lip  tongue or throat swelling  trouble breathing  decreased blood pressure and death. Some people can have life threatening allergic reactions such as tongue swelling and difficulty breathing after eating certain foods. When foods combine with IgE antibodies attached to mast cells those cells release histamine & other potent biochemicals causing blood vessels to leak plasma into surrounding tissues resulting in swelling (edema). If your eyelid swells its unsightly but no big deal. If your tongue or vocal cords swell you could die from suffocation. If enough plasma leaks out blood pressure falls leading to shock.

650	Q:44711A:1277404	Are bug bites the same thing as allergies? Bug bites often cause hives at the site of the bite  sometimes can be large  due to components of the insect bite. Allergies to bug bites or other elements are mediated by elements of the immune system  such as the IgE  the antibody that triggers the immediate allergic reaction resulting in itching and generalized hives  and sometimes leads to anaphylaxis. Mosquito bites  although not life threatening  can be IgE-mediated (to the salivary enzyme in the female mosquito) and cause large local reactions which persist for several days with symptoms of pain  itching  swelling and redness.  The best treatment is prevention of the bites using insect repellants.  I find that Eucalyptus oil works very well in preventing mosquito bites. Bug bites are not the same as allergy. Most folks who have a bug bite (mosquito) will have local swelling and itchiness that resolves relatively quickly.

653	Q:277862A:397401	When my daughter turned 1 we found out she is anaphylaxis to peanuts. Can she out grow the allergy? When should she be tested again? She is 3 now. Lifelong.  I highly recommend you follow up with your pediatrician to get involved with a pediatric allergist who can assist with your child's allergy.  I would also make sure you and your child's caregivers at daycare/school have access to an epi-pen and instructions how to use it.  Medic-alert may also be advisable. We used to think that children never grow out peanut allergy. It turns out that a significant minority of children does outgrow this allergy.  I assume that you have made sure that she does not eat any peanuts so far. Therefore  first you should see an allergist.An allergist would proceed with an evaluation that would determine if she is still allergic and make appropriate suggestions.

660	Q:98188A:160274	Can my toddler's fussiness mean she has a food allergy or not? Symptoms of   food allergies   include: rash/hives  nausea  stomach pain  diarrhea  shortness of breath  wheezing  anaphylaxis.   Food intolerance   is a digestive system response rather than an   immune system   response. Common food allergies include: nuts  fish  shellfish  milk  eggs  soy & wheat. An elimination diet may allow you to rule out this cause for her fussiness. (I think it is behavioral!) Fussiness is not a very specific symptom & is associated with many complaints. When fussiness is related to something in the diet it's more likely an intolerance than an allergy. Your pediatrician or allergist can be of great help here.

664	Q:626205A:938841	I am a allergic keflex (it results in anaphylaxis) but was just prescribed augment in for a possible lymphangitis infection is it safe to take it? There are similarities between Keflex and Augmentin  but they're not the same. For milder reactions such as rash  someone allergic to one may not be allergic to the other. But for severe reactions such as true anaphylaxis  the risk of a similar reaction to Augmentin is too great. There is very little cross-reactivity between the penicillins and cephalosporins.  On the other hand if you have had an anaphylactic reaction to one it makes sense to either avoid the other or to take the first dose in a location in which resuscitation can be effected should you be the victim of the rare reaction.  People allergic to one medication often are predisposed to react to others. Since you had a severe reaction  I wouldn't chance it since there can be some cross reaction Anaphylactic shock  Anaphylaxis  Cephalexin  Infection  Keflex  Lymphangitis
665	Q:81982A:133516	Are there some genetic reasons I get anaphylaxis off and on? Anaphylaxis is a complex medical disease  that has a variety of causes and may have a familial predilection  and can be life threatening. If one suspects they have anaphylaxis then a thorough work - up by an allergist is needed. The symptoms of anaphylaxis can begin as swelling of the head and neck area  tightness in the throat or chest  rash or flushing  or hoarseness (among others) and are very serious!  If they recur then you may have an undiagnosed food allergy or an allergy to a certain chemical or medication.  You must be aware of your surroundings  your symptoms and what your eat.

669	Q:239680A:344890	Are dental shots and locals for delivery everlife-threatening? If given too much local anesthesia it can be life-threateningAlso  in an allergic case it can cause anaphylaxis which can lead to death.But generally they are among the safest anesthetics and the amount to overdose is way beyond what is typically needed Under certain conditons  any injection can be life threatening. But in the vast majority  injections of dental anesthetic are very safe.  Your dentist will know the appropriate dosages and techniques to keep you comfortable and safe.  If you have other complex health issues  your dentist may confer with your MD to make sure you are a good candiate. In children and patients with a heart condition or high blood pressure are at higher risk of   overdosing   with local anesthetics containing epinephrine.  Epinephrine increases heart rate and blood pressure.  It's extremely rare for a patient to die from too much local  but I suppose it is possible and more probable in that population.

679	Q:88126A:145451	If I develop anaphylaxis  how will it be treated? This serves to reiterate Dr Mutnick's answer the treatment for a patient experiencing anaphylaxis is administration of epinephrine. The data in the literature has been very clear those not treated promptly with epinephrine are at further increased risk for bad outcomes. Epinephrine is the ONLY proven effective treatment for anaphylaxis. There is no data to support any benefit from H1/H2 antihistamines or steroids. We give them to decrease the reaction but ONLY epinephrine is recommended in anaphylaxis. Give Epinephrine and call 911.

Not only can proteins in the semen trigger a reaction  but other allergens such as food or drugs can be transferred via semen to a sensitized woman leading to a reaction.  Sometimes the reaction can be very severe such as anaphylaxis. It is not very common but women can develop an allergy to semen  since it is a protein (medically known as   seminal plasma hypersensitivity  ). It is a difficult problem to treat. Basically  you need to use a condom to avoid the contact with the semen. Sometimes  if enough time passes without contact with the semen  the allergy will resolve.

The first thing that comes to mind based just on the question is does this child maybe have some mouth/jaw weakness that would benefit from an oral motor evaluation. The best answer is one obtained in a face to face visit with your physician. Swallowing problems can be from many causes and should be addressed with the help of your pediatrician and maybe a feeding expert (such as an occupational therapist) or an ENT. Less serious causes (sore throat) resolve quickly. More serious causes include a mass in the throat  developmental delays  severe reflux  anaphylaxis  and more.

696	Q:20567A:25573	Is a category 1 wheat allergy dangerous? If you mean you received a Class I grade on an allergy blood test  probably not. Most significant food allergies have a Class III or higher grade. The readings don't always relate precisely to severity  though. With most mild food allergies(no history of anaphylaxis)  we advise the person to try eliminating the positive food for 1-2 weeks and then try eating it to see if symptoms can be provoked. Allergy blood tests (RASTs) are often ranked by class 1  class 2 and so forth  usually up to 6. This reflects the amount of allergic antibody present. However  many other things go into determining whether you will react when eating the food  or how severe the reaction will be. Predicting the severity of the reaction depends on your history  and may require a food challenge.

Death occurs in 1% of all episodes of anaphylaxis. Its victims are often children and young adults in the prime of life. Not fun. Anaphylaxis is a severe potentially life threatening allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis must be dealt with swiftly and taken very seriously. A thorough work up by a Board Certified Allergist is a must to potentially identify the trigger and develop a treatment plan.

Secondly some use such a term for anaphylaxis wich is not neccessarily igE mediatedhttp://www.ajronline.org/content/190/3/666.fullThen there are Gell-Combs reactions which are Type I to IVIs that what you mean? I assume you mean a type 3 immune reaction which is caused by immunoglobulins (antibodies) binding specific materials (antigens) forming a complex that can activate materials in the blood to cause inflammation. This can occur in serum sickness  lupus  hepatitis and many other conditions. Dr. Shulan is correct: type 3 IMMUNE reactions involve IgG & antigen.   CLASS 3 allergy   may also refer to RAST  a blood test for detecting IgE against antigen. For convenience labs define from 5 to 7 levels. CLASS 2 is often borderline & CLASS 3 low positive.

742	Q:92845A:154344	How long after a bee sting can anaphylaxis develop? Anaphylaxis may occur within sec to min. after bee sting and is usually rapid and life threatening. A bee sting may initially not cause a reaction.  It may be the subsequent sting that provokes a response. It is actually statistically rare to have a an anaphylactic reaction to bee stings after an uneventful 1st event. No specific tests can predict evernts. Conservatively-an Epipen may be kept. The relative timeframe for anaphylaxis to occur after exposure to a particular allergen or antigen can vary from seconds to hours. It could take from 30 minutes to an hour before the problem develops.

746	Q:206024A:298691	Can an adult epipen be used on a child during life threatening anaphylaxis? My 7 &9 yo sons have had hive reactions in the past. I keep an epi for me. The dose of epinephrine is 0.005 ml per pound. So a 30 pound child (2 years old) needs EpiPen Jr. (0.15 ml). At 60# we switch to EpiPen (0.3 ml). Many allergists consider the Junior dose inadequate for children over 50 lbs. I switch my patients to EpiPen when they reach 54 lbs. If your kids were my patients I'd tell you to go for it BUT YOU SHOULD DISCUSS THIS QUESTION WITH THEIR DOCTORS. First off  if your kids have only reacted with hives  you need to not over-react unless they have a history of anaphylactic reactions to various things. This should be investigate by a qualified allergist if you are concerned.Second  if their allergies warrent using an epipen  then need to have their own  which will contain an kid's dose vs an adult dose.

747	Q:98256A:164711	will taking aller-tec for hives from swimming work? Aller-tec is the Kirkland generic version of Zyrtec or cetirizine. This is an effective antihistamine for hives. Remember to give it time to work - taking it at least an hour before swimming. Cetirizine causes drowsiness and slowed reflexes in up to 8% of users. Aller-tec or zyrtec is a very good choice  but don't forget to swim with a buddy and have an Epi-Pen available.  There are cases of swimming that triggers anaphylaxis in patients with cold urticaria.

This is a very fast reaction and usually the patient is unconscious as the blood pressure drops quickly during such a severe allergic reaction. I am confident she did not feel it or suffer. I hope this eases your suffering a bit. I am so sorry for your loss.  I have seen many patients in my career who have had anaphylaxis and were brought by ambulance (these reactions were from medications taken at home  bee stings  or allergy shots) and I will tell you that the patients did not have pain.  Anaphylaxis is so severe and so sudden that the patient very often immediately loses consciousness because their blood pressure drops.

760	Q:92746A:265638	I know some people get asthma with exercise  but is there such a thing as anaphylaxis from exercise? Exercise induced anaphylaxis does indeed occur and it is unusual.It can be food associated or not food associated. Any incidence of anaphylaxis needs a thorough eval by an allergist. There is a rare diagnosis called food associated exercise induced anaphylaxis that can occur when the patient eats a certain food (usually wheat  celery  various nuts) and then exercises within 30-60 minutes of eating. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) is a rare disorder in which anaphylaxis occurs after physical activity  The symptoms may include pruritus  hives  flushing  wheezing  and GI involvement  including nausea  abdominal cramping  and diarrhea. If physical activity continues  patients may progress to more severe symptoms as cardiovascular collapses.

It&#x27;s not worth risk of having someone find you unconscious or worse yet  dead. So if you&#x27;ve had an anaphylactic reaction in past  go to hospital now. Have someone drive you (or call 911 equivalent in New Zealand) so you don&#x27;t inadvertently pass out &amp; crash  potentially injuring someone else. Once all is well  ask your doc for EpiPen (or Kiwi equivalent). Keep 2 on your person  just in case. Until you can identify the cause  it can come on at any time - fast and furious.  Even if you have identify the cause  inadvertent exposure to the food etc may still happen.  Be sure to carry an adrenaline kit with you at all times. You tell us that you had an anaphylactic reaction  but experience has shown that not every person who claims to have undergone such a reaction actually had it.

They gave him Prednisone and told him to elevate his feet.  Tuesday morning when he woke up his lips w He  needs a full work up by an allergy specialist  to start.  As above  he should have an epi pen available  to use if he has difficulty breathing or throat swelling.  If he has those things he needs to return to the ER.  A blood test called a serum tryptase might be used to see if what he is having is an allergic reaction.  How much trouble was he having with swallowing?  Another explanation for his symptoms could be a type of urticaria  and may not be straightforward allergy.  People can get hives for no obvious reason  and it would not be unusual to have lip swelling with that problem. There are other blood tests done to look for this problem  and sometimes allergy tests as well.  The treatment for that usually starts with zyrtec 2 to 6 times a day.  Certainly keeping track of his symptoms and what he eats could be helpful  but the problem may not turn out to be allergy. You do not mention any itching. If he is itching  it may be part of urticaria/angioedema (hives/swelling). It is not necessarily anaphylaxis. He needs to be on prednsione  antihistamines such as cetirizine/fexofenadine/hydroxyzine and   H@ blockers   such as ranitidine or famotidine acutely and see an allergist ASAP.

776	Q:71957A:102165	As an adult  I've developed allergies to various fruit - peaches  apples  pears  cherries  nectarines and more. † Organic too What could be the cause? It happens a lot in patients with pollen allergy  up to 30% by some source.  There are shared proteins between certain pollens from trees or weeds with certain fruits  such as peaches  apples  cherries  or melons  etc.  Patients who have those pollen allergy can be allergic to those fruits. A very common seasonal allergy patients complain about is oral allergy with fresh fruits.  Some of the proteins that patients react in trees  grasses  and weeds are very similiar to the proteins to fresh fruit.  Knowing your seasonal allergies may help.  Also seeing an allergist will help determine how serious these allergies are and whether a patient may need a epi pen as well. Dr. Vallury is correct. Also research on a reputable medical website about Oral Allergy Syndrome. This should help If your reactions are local- oral and throat itching and burning- the problem is oral allergy syndrome  which is a cross reaction with pollens.  It causes local irritation  but isn't dangerous.  Reactions like hives  lip/tongue swelling  and wheezing are consistent with true food allergy.  A positive test doesn't mean clinical allergy  just sensitization Fruit allergies can cause itching  irritation and burning in the mouth after eating certain types of fruits.  This generally occurs in people who allergy to pollen from trees.  Most often these symptoms last a few minutes but if large amounts of the offending fruit or vegetable are consumed dangerous anaphylaxis can occur.  This occurs in 1 - 2 % of patients. If you are having local itching  swelling  or tingling of the lips  tongue  or throat after eating fresh fruit  then your body is likely reacting to proteins in the fruit that are similar to birch tree pollen. If you don't have problems with cooked fruit and if you have hay fever symptoms in the spring  then this is the most likely explanation. These symptoms are usually due to a reaction to proteins in fruits and vegetables that cross react with (are similar to) proteins in pollens. This syndrome typically only occurs upon eating the raw fruit and vegetable. If you can tolerate these fruits in cooked or processed forms (apple juice  apple pie  canned peaches  etc.) this confirms that oral allergy syndrome is the cause of your symptoms.

777	Q:561047A:854099	What should I do in case me or someone I know has a serious allergic reaction? Serious allergic reactions are called anaphylaxis and are medical emergencies.  The most effective treatment is Epinephrine (adrenalin) given by injection.  If this drug is not immediately available  call 911 as most paramedics will carry Epi on their rig.

778	Q:561038A:843571	How can I tell if I have an allergic reaction to lidocaine? Allergic reactions to lidocaine are very rare.

A true allergic reaction is more serious  and could include swelling of the lips and tongue  asthma/breathing trouble  nausea/vomiting  low blood pressure  and fainting. The old ester based local anesthetics  like Novocain did cause allergy in some patients. The newer amide agents not so much. This would include lidocaine  bupivicaine  ropivicaine.

Reactions vary from mild redness & itching at the injection site (common) to hives or anaphylaxis (~1 in 1000 injections). Risk is greater if you have asthma. Competent nursing staff & waiting 30 minutes after help a lot. Immunotherapy can be risky in some settings. When done right by a board certified allergist in a controlled setting with a gradual build up risks are rare. Reactions can always occur as you are being injected with something to which you are allergic.

787	Q:660990A:1002892	Anaphylactic shock in 1987 from IVP dye for CT. Now need CT w/ contrast. 1 Dr says I CAN have it because dye is different. Other Dr says NO. Thoughts? They should consult any allergist they can find since there is a SIMPLE pre-treatment protocol with three medications that can decrease the risk of a reaction by 90% There are two basic types of dye used: Ionic high-osmolality contrast media (HOCM) and non-ionic low-osmolality contrast media (LOCM). LOCM has become the preferred form of IV dye in recent years  given its better safety record. If you had HOCM before  you may be ok with LOCM.

788	Q:10507A:63249	How common is anaphylaxis shock with quinolones? THe  most common allergic drug reactions is to pencillin like medications. But as more meciations are used that are not penicillin like one can see more reactions to these meds. Immediate allergic reactions to quinolones have increased over the past 20 years largely due to increased use. In Spain they're the 3rd most common cause of immediate hypersensitivity reactions after beta-lactams (pencillins) & nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions also include hives  vomiting  and respiratory symptoms as well as anaphylaxis.

789	Q:670439A:1030351	How prevalent are food allergies and is it easy to identify the symptoms of a food allergy? 3-5% of children have food allergies 1-3% of adults have allergies  you need to see an allergist to determine what you are allergic to and what you need to avoid. symptoms include hives  swelling of the skin  cramping and diarrhea  shortness of breath  wheezing  and in extreme cases anaphylaxis Allergies  Anaphylactic shock  Anaphylaxis  Breathlessness  Child allergies  Child Health  Children  Diarrhea  Dysentery  Food allergies
790	Q:49548A:48289	breathless when i go to take a shower? Asthma or even congestive heart failure (CHF) may explain shortness of breath (SOB) when showering.  I will assume that there are no hives on your body when you shower because a rare disease involves cold or heat induced hives and anaphylaxis which could cause SOB.   I recommend you get a breathing test and maybe an EKG to check on your lungs and heart. Have you had this all your life  or just recently? Is it associated with a different place to shower? Do you wheeze? Do you get dizzy? Do you get chest pain? Best to ask your doctor to check you out.

794	Q:271430A:393231	What happens if you let hours go by after your anaphylaxis reaction without seeing MD? Anaphylaxis ends in death in about 1% of episodes. Delayed administration of epinephrine increases the risk of death & the likelihood of persistent symptoms & hospitalization. The treatment of anaphylaxis IS the prompt administration of injected epinephrine (EpiPen) followed by medical observation & if necessary supportive care. This action significantly increases your odds of being in the 99%. Adrenaline  Anaphylaxis  Epinephrine  Supportive care  Epipen  Hospitalization  Anaphylactic shock
795	Q:20281A:61268	What complications can develop from using a Epi-Pen? The only adverse effect I've seen to EpiPen is when the directions are not followed & the device is held backwards. The needle can pass right through your thumb & nail. Worse you can get epinephrine inside your thumb causing pain & decreased blood flow. Otherwise epinephrine is a very safe drug. Vomiting  dizziness & occasional jitteriness are the only side-effects in children & young adults. Epi-Pen is used for treating anaphylaxis.  Side effects can include paleness  vomiting and a rapid pulse.

796	Q:159466A:235219	Is laryngospasm a symptom of asthma or of anaphylaxis? If by laryngospasm it is meant  closing of the vocal cords with out swelling of the VC then no. However  there is an entity called vocal cord dysfunction  in which the VC closed inappropriately and cause   wheezing   and the pt is misdiagnosed with asthma. In anaphylaxis  the VC can swell b/c of the allergic reaction and cause problems. Thiis is a reflex that occurs occasionally after surgery due to irritation of the larynx. It causes   roaring disease  in horses when they eat a plant that contains an enzyme that destroys vitamin B1. It is beause of an irritability of the recurrent laryngeal nerve that innervates the cords. Get rid of all sugar   junk   and try taking B1.

801	Q:196058A:395440	Can an allergy to cats be deadly?  Can someone have anaphylaxis? Severe cat allergy may cause asthma which could lead to respiratory problems.  Since avoidance is a appropriate step  patients usually remove themselves from exposure as well as using controller and rescue medications.  I doubt that cat exposure would ever lead to symptoms of anaphylaxis- skin  cardiac  gastrointestinal   or circulatory. Someone allergic to cats who lives with cats will not likely have acute anaphylaxis but may have symptoms of chronic allergic rhinitis and asthma. When a patient with severe cat allergy who doesn't live with cats enters a home with a cat acute symptoms may occur. This may include throat closure (laryngospasm).  I have never heard of this resulting in death. But it's not fun.

809	Q:856382A:1227285	Is a CT scan without ivp dye as accurate as a ct scan with IVP dye of the abdomen? I have anaphylaxis to the dye. Generally speaking  the Dye often yields a better result.  Ask the Dr.&#x27;s what they are looking for and you can discuss with the radiologist what test is best for you with your Dye allergy.  If important  you may need to be given a prep for a dye allergy.  Best wishes. Contrast (dye) adds additional characterization of soft tissues  vascular structures  and the urinary collecting system.

829	Q:7271A:5677	What is the worst thing that could happen due to an allergic reaction? Anaphylaxis is the most severe type of allergic reaction. It results in swelling of areas within the mouth  throat  and upper airways  which can cause severe difficulty in breathing. Anaphylaxis can also have GI complications as well. Doctors give epinephrine to families where anaphylaxis is a risk. These are commonly called 'Epi-Pens'. The most severe allergic reaction  so called anaphylaxis  involve shortness of breath/wheezing  hypotension  urticarial rash (hives)  and swelling of vocal cords.  Anaphylactic reaction can be deadly if an appropriate treatment is not rendered in time. Peanut and bee venom allergy are good examples. In severe cases of allergic reactions  a person can develop anaphylaxis which can include tightening of the airways/throat to cause problems breathing and sometimes even stop breathing.  It can also lead to a drop in blood pressure/shock which can lead to death. Hypotension  shock  or closing of the throat. The worse allergic reaction which typically occurs to severe food allergy is anaphylaxis is defined as   a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death  .  Symptoms may include hives or swollen lips  difficulty breathing and reduced blood pressure leading to shock. your lips  tongue and airways (large and small) could all swell shut.  At the same time your blood pressure could drop  this is called anaphylaxis. Symptoms from an allergic reaction can range from an annoying symptoms such as itch or irritation to death. Which is usually secondary to hypotension or asphyxiation.  Less commonly hypoxemia from severe bronchospasm can also occur. The worst thing that happen from an allergic reaction is death. This  most serious allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis and can occur after exposure to certain foods  bees sting reaction  medication reactions or other unusual causes. The most severe reaction that can occur after repeated exposure to something you are allergic to is called anaphylaxis.

856	Q:497A:26366	What is an allergic reaction? an allergic reaction is an overreaction of the immune system by an allergic individual to a substance that is normally harmless.  Reactions can include runny or stuffy nose (allergic rhinitis) wheezing and cough (asthma) or skin reactions like eczema or hive. ( A severe reaction can lead to difficult breathing  shock and even death in the case of anaphylaxis.) An allergic reaction is when a trigger  either ingested or in the environment  causes the body to release histamine and leukotrienes. The reaction can be either local  like an insect bite or sting  or systemic (widespread throughout the body) such as what happens with ragweed. The roots of   allergy   are from Greek   allos   (different) and   ergos   (action).  So  an allergic reaction is a   different   (from normal) reaction.  The reaction occurs to an allergen.  An allergen can be a pollen (ragweed)  food (peanut)  animal (dust mite or bee venom)  or other foreign substances.  Symptoms occur due to histamine and other chemicals and cause sneezing  runny nose  etc. Hives  Immune diseases  Anaphylaxis  Shock  NaSal  Allergic reaction  Cough  Wheezing  Nose  Eczema Allergic reaction  Child allergies  Body  Systemic  Histamine  Insect bite  Local  Allergies Rhinitis  NaSal  Allergic reaction  Sneeze  Child allergies  Nose  Allergen  Histamine  Mite  Pollen Hives  Immune diseases  Anaphylaxis  Shock  NaSal  Allergic reaction  Cough  Wheezing  Nose  Eczema Allergic reaction  Child allergies  Body  Systemic  Histamine  Insect bite  Local  Allergies Rhinitis  NaSal  Allergic reaction  Sneeze  Child allergies  Nose  Allergen  Histamine  Mite  Pollen Hives  Immune diseases  Anaphylaxis  Shock  NaSal  Allergic reaction  Cough  Wheezing  Nose  Eczema Allergic reaction  Child allergies  Body  Systemic  Histamine  Insect bite  Local  Allergies Rhinitis  NaSal  Allergic reaction  Sneeze  Child allergies  Nose  Allergen  Histamine  Mite  Pollen

862	Q:212154A:395424	What do you mean by anaphylaxis? Anaphylaxis is a severe  life-threatening allergic reaction  usually to a defined trigger (insect sting  medication  food). The reaction usually affects multiple body systems and is characterized by multiple symptoms (cough  wheeze  shortness of breath  throat discomfort  swelling of the lips/tongue  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  or hives). Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction affecting several parts of the part simultaneously. Mast cells release histamine & other substances making blood vessels leaky. The plasma leaking out causes swelling in the skin (hives & angioedema) & windpipe (laryngospasm) as well as asthma  vomiting  gut pain. If enough plasma leaks out the patient may go into shock. Death may ensue.

863	Q:56570A:89259	can a neurological event trigger an anaphilactic response ? Anaphylaxis is due to allergy  but can cause neurological symptoms. An anaphylactic reaction is an allergic reaction  between an allergic antibody made by your immune system and an allergen that you inhale  ingest  or inject. Since a neurological event does not involve introducing an allergen into the body  the event in and of itself cannot cause true anaphylaxis.

875	Q:70631A:98841	Is there a medication that can cure urticaria or anaphylaxis? Unfortunately  nothing makes them go away forever.  If urticaria or anaphylaxis is due to food allergy  sometimes a patient can naturally   outgrow   the allergy.  There are medical research on-going to see if we can actively   desensitize   patients to food allergen.  But it is still in research state. Although very difficult to cure hives and anaphylaxis especially if the cause is unknown  there are many treatment recommendations for controlling the hives such as high dose antihistamines and having an dpi pen available. There is no   cure   for urticaria or anaphylaxis other than to avoid the allergens that cause them  if they have or can be identified. Antihistamines are typically effective for treating urticaria  but true anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that is best treated by activating the emergency medical system.

877	Q:20268A:60301	What is the length of the effects of an Epi-pen? I agree with Drs. Murphy & Rhein. In an episode of life-threatening anaphylaxis epinephrine buys you the time to call 911 & begin to receive comprehensive emergency treatment. Once you get over the squeamishness of injecting yourself or your child it's an incredibly safe & effective drug. Benadryl doesn't hold a candle to epi. Epi may only last 15 minutes but those minutes are critical for life. The effects of an Epi-pen wear off after 15 to 20 minutes. Epinephrine when used for anaphylaxis generally lasts a very short time. In general  if you use one uses their injectable epinephrine for a severe allergy reaction they must call 911 and get immediate help. The reason being is that the reaction may become more severe  last longer than expected or come back again. All of these scenarios require further care in the hospital setting.

878	Q:50489A:63257	How are food allergies tested? Food allergies can be diagnosed by history and skin testing. Often if the test are equivocal  then an oral challenge is done with the food. The food can be given in small amounts either in a   blinded   form (ground up in capsules) or in a pure form  and the individual observed for a length of time. Food allergies can be tested by either skin testing or by blood testing.  However  the gold standard to prove a food allergy is the double blind placebo controlled food challenge. History trumps skin & blood testing for food allergy. With a history of a reaction like hives  difficulty swallowing  throat tickle  vomiting  asthma or anaphylaxis minutes to hours after eating a food negative skin & blood tests are insufficient to rule-out allergy. A positive test is usually convincing. Mostly we do unblinded challenges in the office reserving double-blind for ambiguous cases.

879	Q:33246A:82533	Can someone develop an allergy to latex later in life? Generally you have to become sensitized to latex before you can become allergic to it.  This means you need to be exposed to it at least once for your immune system to   learn   or recognize latex  and then again another time  for it to respond/react to the latex.  It is this response that leads to the rash  itching  etc. Any allergy can become manifest at any age in life  including latex allergy. It's hard to get latex allergy. Nurses develop eczema or contact dermatitis after using latex gloves for years. Later anaphylaxis  severe life-endangering form of allergy  occurs if latex contacts a mucosal surface - like a balloon in your mouth - or during surgery when the surgeon's gloves touches the inside of the body.

882	Q:1405A:17901	When can I feed my baby shellfish? Unless there is a STRONG family history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis) to shellfish  you can give it to your baby when you start solid foods. Very recent expert opinion suggests that even with a family history of food allergy  early avoidance is probably unnecessary. Allergists disagree about this  but if there is a family history of shellfish allergy  all would probably delay introducing it until 2 years old.  If there is no family history  it can be tried at 1 year old  when the gut is fully mature. After the first birthday  a baby can try shellfish.  The adult feeding the baby should be sure that the shellfish is chopped or mashed up so not to be chokable to the baby. There is no good evidence that delaying shellfish beyond 6 months prevents allergic reactions. If there is a close family history of shellfish allergy  you may wish to delay to 2 to 3 years  but that advice too is not evidence based but rather a simple precaution. Start with small amounts of   soft   shellfish easy to puree like crab or lobster.  Never feed your baby undercooked/raw shellfish. Eventhough Shellfish is in the   top 10   most allergenic foods The American Academy of Pediatrics reversed  the recommendation on waiting off until the first yeat of life stating there is no evidence that delaying certain foods prevents a reaction to them.However  be sure you introduce something that you can purree and never give uncooked seafood.

884	Q:20165A:55494	How do you know if you are having anaphylaxis? Anaphylaxis is a severe  whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom  the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again  an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis happens quickly after the exposure  is severe  and involves the whole body. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-ending allergic reaction. Parts of the body involved: skin  heart  & respiratory & digestive systems. In anaphylaxis at least 2 are involved. Skin symptoms in 95% - hives  swelling of eyelids  lips  hands  feet or overall flushing.

916	Q:60078A:90213	at 11months my son was immunized for h1n1. two days later he had an anaphylactic reaction to peanut. coincidence or cause. there is no family hx.? I have never read of  seen a patient with  or been told by a colleague of such an occurance.Highly unlikely causation. Flu vaccine contains no peanut products.  However  immunizations   gear up   the immune system.  At least theoretically  a person is more prone to allergic reactions when the immune system is flared-up.  For example  skin allergies often flare-up when nasal allerges are also flaring. Anaphylactic reactions require previous exposure and the production of antibodies against the allergen (in this case peanut). This process takes at least one week and usually two weeks. Your son was already sensitized when he received his H1N1 vaccine and was just waiting for a second exposure to peanut. Initial exposure may have been peanut in breast milk.

921	Q:52875A:69890	What's the best way to stop a food allergy (immediate or delayed  but not anaphylactic shock) reaction? When it comes to food allergy reactions  use Epi and get to the hospital.  Even if it appears to be a mild reaction symptoms can progress rapidly and next thing you know your airflow is impeded.  Don't second guess  Epi is safe and effective and lifesaving in many cases. That is a difficult question to answer. Most individuals with food reactions are experiencing anaphylaxis yet will deny it. The only treatment that will help during a food reaction is injectable epinephrine. Antihistamines and brochodilators are helpful adjuncts. One should strictly avoid the food they are allergic to and been seen by an Allergist to map out treatment plans. If a reaction such as itching happens to a food- an antihistamine like benadryl may help.  However  be careful with food allergies because they can worsen each time you eat that particular food.  Therefore the first time you may feel just mild itching and swelling but the next time it could be a full anaphylactic reaction.  The safest thing to do is to avoid the food until you get allergy tested.

930	Q:868887A:1242563	What are the alternatives if one is allergic to amoxillin  ampicillin  erythromycin and clindamycin? There are many alternative antibiotics if you need one. The specific one will depend on the infection; your MD can discuss this with you at that time. I also recommend seeing an allergist. They can determine if reactions you had were truly due to antibiotics  if you&#x27;ve lost your allergy over time  etc. They can also help you take those meds safely without reaction if there&#x27;s no alternative drug. It depends on the type of penicillin allergy. if just a rash you can take cephalosporins like Keflex. If hives  throat swelling or anaphylaxis you cannot take them. Erythromycin frequently causes nausea and vomiting-not an allergy. If this is the reaction you can take Zithromax.

939	Q:704272A:1194140	How do i identify a food allergy? Food allergies typically trigger skin and GI symptoms and can cause anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).  Symptoms of food allergy occur within minutes to hours of ingestion (sometimes on skin contact) with only small amounts of the allergenic food.  Food allergy testing is not as reliable as we desire  but it is good at ruling out food allergy if test negative. 6 foods cause 90% of reactions! In many cases the medical history will suggest the food causing the problem. This can often be confirmed with allergy testing (skin tests and/or blood tests). Sometimes the allergist will do an in-office food challenge.

958	Q:64497A:93769	how do i kno if im allergic to nuts? Allergy to tree nuts and any food for that matter is a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed by skin testing and / or blood testing. As was discussed in another post a skin test or blood test does not diagnose a allergy in the absence of clinical symptoms ( with the exception of some very unique cases). See you Doctor for clarification. You are not allergic to nuts (or any other food) if you have a positive skin or blood test to that food but have no symptoms when you eat the food. Symptoms of food allergy occurring within 2 hours of eating include mouth itching & swelling  hives anywhere  nausea & vomiting after eating a specific food  difficulty breathing & anaphylaxis. If any of these things occur see an allergist for testing. Allergies manifest in all different manners  from the simple rash  itch  hives  cough  runny nose to more severe of nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  swelling of body parts  shortness of breath and even anaphylaxis. You really should see an Allergist for testing  if appropriate. You can discuss with your allergist your symptoms and he or she can work you up.

If one is diagnosed with food allergy  then it is known that severe reactions can occur particularly with peanuts  tree nuts and shellfish. Skin testing or blood testing for these allergens do not predict the clinical symptoms that can occur. The primary reason is that you never know how severe future reactions can be. Just because you've never had an anaphylactic reaction to peanut does not mean you never will. Please carry your Epipen!

965	Q:98447A:160543	Can all allergies cause anaphylaxis?   Anaphylaxis   (extreme response to food/drug allergy) is a serious  potentially life threatening response notable for swelling  hives  low BP  dilated blood vessels. The immune system creates a disease fighting antibiody (IgE) toward a harmless substance (like food).   Allergies   cause sneezing  coughing  wheezing & itching. Some allergies can be severe & possibly fatal-anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is often an extreme allergic reaction  but may not always be readily attributable to an allergy.  Some people  for example  may experience anaphylaxis from exercise under certain circumstances.  Most episodes of anaphylaxis may be linked to allergic sensitization as in the case of insect sting reactions  certain drugs  foods  and in some individuals with severe inhalant allergies.

967	Q:904436A:1289639	Is anaphlaxis shock caused by an immune problem? anaphylaxis is usually secondary to an allergic reaction to a food or medication but it can also be idiopathic or related to food intake or exercise. Mastocytosis can also be an occult cause of it. See an allergist to help you find the cause A majority of the time it is caused by an immune reaction but at other times certain drugs just provoke release of the same chemicals causing the anaphylactic reaction as in the case of x-ray dye reaction. Some prefer to call the non-immunologic ones anaphylactoid reaction but the treatment is the same.

969	Q:86378A:141749	How much should I worry about stridor? Stridor is caused by obstruction of the windpipe at or just below the vocal cords. In children typical causes are croup  larygospasm as in anaphylaxis or hereditary angioedema  vocal cord dysfunction or an aspirated foreign body. Immediate emergency evaluation is mandatory to avoid death. Croup  the most common cause  usually responds to medication but intubation is sometimes necessary. True stridor means between 10-20% of the airway is open; seek care an in an emergency room with access to an ICU immediately.  The source of stridor should be located and treated  and (frequently) the patient will need to have a breathing tube placed in order to avoid dying. True stridor is considered a medical emergently since it represents an airway which is closing. If a patient truly has strider  911 should be called and the person taken immediately to the nearest ER. A tube may need to be placed in the airway so that artificial ventilation can be done while the etiology is diagnosed and treated. Stridor can be life-threatening and even fatal.

An anaphylactic reaction is an allergic reaction to a trigger such as a food (peanuts  tree nuts  shellfish) or stinging insect (wasp  honeybee  etc.) that involves multiple body systems at the same time. Thus  you might experience hives/rash (skin)  cough/shortness of breath (respiratory)  vomithing/diarrhea (gastrointestinal)--these symptoms usually occur within minutes of exposure to a trigger. Hives  Difficulty breathing  Diarrhea  Anaphylaxis  Allergic reaction  Cough  Rash  Body  Human immunodeficiency virus  Breathing
974	Q:625716A:940327	New med given  2 hours later couldnt breath. Anaphylaxis? Can undiagnosed anaphylaxis kill someone 36 hours after initial attack. If you took a new medication and couldn't breathe well 2 hours later  you should return and report that to your doctor immediately. It certainly could be part of an anaphylactic response  some of which are fatal. Also  there is what is called a 'slow-releasing factor' of anaphylaxis  so anaphylaxis can indeed occur up to 48 hours or longer after exposure. The full syndrome includes low BP (shock). Clearly  you have had a serious reaction to the medication. Serious allergic reaction results in bronchoconstriction and chest tightness  swelling the sensation of   closing   of the throat  as well as potential drop in pressure constitutes anaphylaxis. You should discuss this with your doctor now as depending on the drug etc. allergic effects may persist. If you are fine now you should be ok. You might request a blood test to see if it was the med that caused the trouble breathing but I certainly would not swallow it again!! Anaphylactic shock  Anaphylaxis

977	Q:750950A:1096389	Had an panic attack  after eating Ice Cream with caramel. And i mistakenly thought i had anaphylaxis. After that i was afraid to eat everything. Fear? Ok  you got scared; give yourself a break. It is ok ! Don t let this deter you from eating ice cream  or become a problem. Use this experience in its positive side: to carefully select good foods  natural products and (why not?) including ice cream if you want (after all  you did not have an allergy to it  right?). Have a healthy discussion about this with your Dr. what about milk? Although there are different pathways to develop phobias and panic  many people experience   emotional conditioning   by having a panic attack or severe anxiety symptoms in the context of certain objects or situations. As a result  the individual associates fear (panic) or anxiety with the context of the symptoms (such as   must have been the food!  ) I  suggest talking to your doc  but seems likely Unnecessary fears can emerge by association.  You've quickly learned to fear eating because eating ice cream was associated with a panic attack  which was not any fun!  This is the time to deeply relax and then eat something gradually while maintaining deep relaxation.  The fear will go away by eating again and not having a panic attack while doing so.

980	Q:624263A:935775	What is it called when I am allergic to fresh fruit? May be fructose intolerance but the problem may be sugar from other sources. A patient of mine had a dx of fructose intolerance and it was his sugary diet that was the real cause It is very common in people who also suffer from Hayfever or allergic rhinitis. It's also called Fruit-Pollen Syndrome. Peeling your fruit can help reduce the amount of allergy causing proteins. Heating the fruit can help denature them.Even cutting the fruit and letting them sit can help due to oxidation. A small percentage of people can get anaphylaxis and need to carry epipen. Good luck! 
981	Q:860502A:1236591	Can taking antihistamines beforehand prevent death due to anaphylaxis? There is no evidence that antihistamine alone can prevent an anaphylactic reaction although it may potentially reduce the severity.  Avoidance of the trigger is the only answer.

989	Q:437288A:658085	would a baby die of egg allergy if it took a uncooked egg? The correct question is   COULD  a baby die   not WOULD a baby die  .  It depends on the severity of the allergy  the amount of raw egg swallowed  and the availability or unavailability of effective treatment. Effective treatment usually means EpiPen Junior & a 911 call. The risk of death from anaphylaxis to foods is 1%. 99% survive and do just fine. That  however  is no reason for complacency. Death due to food allergy is rare  but very unusual. If the baby is allergic to eggs  the reaction would be the same whether the egg is cooked or not. Eating uncooked eggs is a bad idea for young children for several reasons.  There is a risk of infection from bactera on the egg. Also egg should always be introduced Into a diet in it's cooked form since the allergens   denature  (break down) when cooked.

991	Q:7272A:76623	How can you tell if a child is allergic to antibiotics? Typically if a child is allergic to antibiotics  you'll notice she will develop a rash at some point during the course of antibiotics.  The rash can happen in the middle or end of the course of antibiotics.  An allergy can also manifest itself with severe stomach upset  particularly vomiting  and rarely  trouble breathing.  Call your MD right away if you see any of these signs. Can have a rash over the body or hives on the body. Should be evaluated by your doctor Take a picture then take your child to your Pediatrician.Usually children have a viral illness on top of a bacterial infection that requires taking antibiotics and these viral rash never fails to appear when they are on them.They may be treated for strep throat that can cause scarlatina rash and mistaken for allergic reaction.Some parents think diaper rash and diarrhea are  allergic reactions! If a child is allergic to an antibiotic  he may get a rash during the time he is taking the antibiotic  but some people get a rash a few days or weeks after using the antibiotic.  Other symptoms can occur also.  With severe allergies  a person can have swelling of the face/lips/tongue  wheezing  difficulty breathing  dizziness  and low blood pressure . . . this type of reaction is an emergency! Babies and rashes go together so often that anything can seem like an allergy. If your baby is on antibiotics  or was recently on some  the most concerning things to see would be face  or lip swelling  or a rash that you can see and feel and seems itchy. It still might be a viral rash  but would be good to have checked. Diarrhea and stomach upset are common side effects but not allergies. The most definitive way is to have an Allergist Specialist  test for it. The reason is for this recommendation is that certain infections can cause rashes wrongly attributed to the antibiotic- For example- strept infections can cause a red  sandpaper rash or else  mycoplasma pneumonia manifesting as erythema multiforme). Testing by an experienced technician can really clarify these situations. The most common allergic reactions to antibiotics include a rash (though not always). Rarely  a more serious reaction can include hives  swelling of the face  lips  tongue or throat  and difficulty breathing.  This rare but life threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can occur within a few minutes to an hour of taking the medication. This can be difficult to be certain  because many times the infection that the child has causes a rash but the antibiotic is blamed for the rash. Antibiotic allergy can cause rash/hives  swollen lips/tongue/eyelids/face  vomiting  diarrhea  or wheezing. An allergist can perform skin testing (especially accurate for penicillin) that can help diagnose whether your child has an antibiotic allergy. Though the most common allergic reactions to antibiotics are rashes  most rashes that occur while on antibiotics are not caused by allergies. Many people think they're allergic because of rashes  but in fact they're not. Have the rash examined by your doctor  or take photos  to try to help determine if it's really an allergy. Sometimes  it can be difficult to know for sure. There are several pathways that cause drug allergy.  The classic one is immediate  IgE mediated and usually occurs within 1 hour of exposure.  There are other pathways which can be delayed from a day to several weeks.  You will usually see a type of rash as one of the first symptoms in mos cases but that does not necessarily rule out a hypersensitivity reaction. Monitor all  symptoms carefully.

997	Q:498A:63720	What is anaphylaxis? Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may even cause death Typically the reaction is  to a food  drug or hymenoptera (bee like insects) sting.  Symptoms include hives  difficult breathing  and shock.  Anaphylaxis is treated with epinephrine injection. This is a severe  multi-system allergic reaction.  It can be life threatening and you should immediately seek medical attention.  During this reaction you can experience throat swelling  difficulty breathing and full body hives.  Your blood pressure can become dangerously low.  People who are at risk for this typically carry Epipens with them to begin to treat this reaction. Anaphylaxis denotes an allergic reaction that involves two or more organ systems.  For example  hives+ vomiting (in response to an allergen) = anaphylaxis.  Anaphylactic shock describes a situation where the anaphylaxis progressed to the point of organ failure.  Prompt use of Epinephrine injectors could avert the progression of anaphylactic reaction toward the shock. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction involving several parts of your body. Death occurs in about 1% of episodes caused by suffocation (your windpipe closes off) or shock (your blood pressure falls & your brain doesn't get enough oxygen). Typical symptoms include hives  vomiting  difficulty breathing & a sense of doom. Epinephrine is the drug of choice. Don't be afraid to use it!

1008	Q:254906A:364235	Why does anaphylaxis occur? You are suddenly exposed to allergens combining with antibodies already attached to mast cells. Mast cell activation releases histamine & a panoply of other active biological agents causing blood vessels to leak plasma )the part of your blood without red cells). Leakage results in swelling in your skin  throat  lungs & GI tract. If enough plasma leaks out blood pressure falls leading to shock. Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that can result in death. Typical triggers include food  sting  and medications.

1010	Q:90700A:146978	Can people with seafood allergies go scuba diving? You should have no problems doing scuba with a seafood allergy - as long as you don't touch fish without gloves on.    but just swimming should pose no danger to you Usually seafood allergies mean that ingestion results in hives or other severe allergic reactions  anaphylaxis.  Since there is no ingestion while scuba diving  an ingestion reaction is unlikely.If the diver wears a wet suit and gloves   a contact skin reaction is also unlikely.  Consult an allergist if appropriate. Seafood allergies should have no relation to swimming in salt water or fresh water  or scuba diving. Only if one has a skin allergy to some of the various minerals in water is there a problem (for example  chlorine in pools).  It is only INGESTING seafood that one must avoid if allergic to that specific seafood. As I mentioned in recent answer  shellfish and other types fish r different types. Just don't eat what you see !

Anaphylaxis after surgery is a very complex problem And can only be addressed properly by close collaboration between surgeon anesthesiologist and an allergist. It is definitely not normal and you  should pursue a full evaluation as soon as possible. Some type of testing may be necessary to determine the cause and prevent future episodes. Possible causes include drug allergy or latex allergy. Anaphylaxis is uncommon. It is important for you to know exactly what happened so that you can inform healthcare providers who care for you in the future. Ask your surgeon or anesthesiologist for that information. Even if they are not certain which medication or material caused the reaction  they should be able to provide information that will be useful in the future.

1019	Q:28856A:56892	What are some tips for running with asthma? If you have exercise-induced asthma  your doctor will likely prescribe an inhaler for you to use prior to running and as needed once you stop running. You should also try to avoid any known asthma triggers when running esp outdoors (ex pollen). People with exercise-induced or regular asthma can use steroid inhalers (Flovent) to reduce swelling  mucus  and   sensitivity   in the airways. Bronchodilators (Ventolin) enlarge the diameter of the airways to help air flow and mucus come out of the lungs. Advair and Symbicort are good combination inhalers. Singulair chewables are another preventive medicine. Wearing a doctor's mask can filter air.

1026	Q:20195A:48448	How does asthma spread? Asthma is inherited from your parents.  Any allergic disease in your parents puts you at risk for asthma.  Whether you develop asthma or not is due to your environmental exposures. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways caused by both inherited and environmental factors. It doesn't spread like infections but develops in patients when inflammation leads to spasm of muscles around the windpipe and the airways become hypersensitive. Many factors trigger asthma  including allergies  respiratory infections  weather changes  irritants  exercise  and acid reflux.

There is pulmonary function testing with bronchoprovocation that can tell if you have the tendency for bronchospasm. If these tests reveal bronchospasm  you may have asthma. Asthma  by definition  is recurrent episodes of reversible airway obstruction. Your doctor can diagnose asthma if the clinical picture fits in conjunction with this testing. Astma is an inflammatory disease of the air tubes of the lungs. In many people allergic reactions are the major factors that contributed too that inflammation  but in others allergy is on minimal if at all a factor. The lung are still inflamed and therefore over or hyper-reactive and therefore still tighten and wheeze with cold air  exertion  smoke  colds  etc. You certainly have reactive airway issues and should have an inhaler for those times. Asthma is more of a chronic problem so if these issues are occurring weekly or even  monthly you may have asthma. It is an allergy problem. Discuss it with your doctor.

1028	Q:244737A:368230	Is guifenesen good to use with asthma? Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It helps loosen congestion in your chest and throat  making it easier to cough out through your mouth. Its effects maybe more theoretical than practical. Drinking adequate fluids will produce the same effect. I hate to leave the decision for you to make for yourself but   honestly  I would rather have you push more fluids. Guaifenesin is a medicine in the class called expectorants.  They are used to thin mucous in the air passages to make it easier to cough out the mucous and clear the possible plugging due to the mucous and clear the airways.  It won't help asthma directly but may help to loosen the mucous that may be blocking/closing some of the airways.

1036	Q:98533A:162326	Is it bad to go outside when flowers first bloom when you have asthma? If you are allergic to those flowers blooming  they should be avoided as much as possible. If you are allergic to pollen  stay indoors as much as possible during high pollen count days. The same can be said of poor air quality in general. If none of these things results in bronchospasm for you  then no need to avoid them. Flowers bloom when other airborne plant pollen  especially tree in the spring  is in the air.  If a plant is colorful or has a pleasant odor  it is to attract insects for pollination.

1042	Q:359914A:512746	How can I reduce the frequency of my asthma attacks? Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is managed by identifying one's triggers  use of appropriate antiinflammatory / bronchodilatory medicines and aggressively managing any flares. Dr. Murphy is completely correct. Immunotherapy add an additional component to managing asthma. Conventional immunotherapy involves injections of the allergens that trigger your asthma. Over time you develop tolerance to these triggers. Monoclonal antibody therapy with omalizumab removes IgE from your lungs preventing allergens from triggering asthma attacks. Both are useful for asthma control. If you are having fequent attacks  you must be exposed to   triggers   on a constant basis. You have two routes: first identify the triggers and remove them as much as possible  second  if your attacks are frequent you need a   controller   inhaler in  addition to your   rescue   inhaler. This   if prescribed   must be used every day not only when needed. See your physician. See a board certified allergist for evaluation and treatment.  Cannot be cured  but appropriate management is usually very helpful. You ARE already taking a maintenance controller medicine eg Advair  dulera  Qvar etc and a rescue inhaler eg albuterol ventolin  Proair. My advice is to take them DAILY as prescribed and encourage follow up with your doctor as scheduled.Clinically you may feel better   but it takes three months for the inflammation of the lungs to heal. You may also need allergy meds etc. go see your doctor. You don't tell us what medications you are taking and if you suffer nasal allergy or reflux of stomach acid. Do you smoke? Do you have a pet that you are allergic to. All of these need to be addressed. As mentioned by my colleague  you need to be compliant  with your medications. If you haven't seen an allergist  do so ASAP. If you have  go back and review your treatment. Avoid triggers like cold & dry air  take inhaler correctly  keep track about how many day a week (day time) you use albuterol inhaler  treat your allergies  don't smoke. Just a few.

1045	Q:47803A:120569	What is nocturnal asthma? If you think you have persistent asthma but don't have symptoms at night you probably don't have asthma. Except in its mildest forms asthma is almost always worse at night. Your body's own supply of corticosteroids & bronchodilators  both produced in the adrenal glands  reaches its daily low point at night resulting in increased inflammation in the breathing tubes. It's 2 AM & you're coughing. Nocturnal refers to night time. So  nocturnal asthma is present when an asthmatic awakens from sleep with asthma sxs like shortness of breath  cough  etc. There are medications that can be given to try to prevent this from happening. Keep track of how often this happens  what time the awakenings occur  exact sxs present  etc so your doctor can prescribe an effective regimen for you.

1063	Q:237627A:340466	Do air purifiers help cure asthma? Air filters capture particles; some purifiers treat the air chemically. How the air changes depends on which you use. In order for a filter to have a significant effect on an allergy  it needs to filter the volume of air in the room at least 10 times per hour and be highly efficient  e.g. 99.74%. They help most for pet dander: light particles that stay airborne much longer than dust mite particles But they may help remove allergen particles from the air that may trigger the Hypersensitivity reaction that is the basis of asthma.

1068	Q:218850A:408949	What can I do about asthma attacks at school? Recurrent asthma attacks at school are a sign that your child's asthma is not well controlled. If the problem persists even if you're following the Asthma Action Plan  that means that the asthma is changing and the Action Plan needs to be adjusted. Time to see your allergist for a reevaluation. Your child's condition should be discussed with the school's nurse or whoever is in charge of such thing. It is likely that your child's control may require reassessment if it is getting worse. You may also want to check with the school about new animals (particularly fur bearing) being used for instructions. If your child is on regular meds for asthma it would be prudent to have a prepared asthma action plan on file with the school nurse. There are many templates on various asthma websites & the kids PCP may have one s/he likes to use. They list the meds the kids are on  the type of rescue meds that could be administered at school & the point where the kid needs to come in for urgent care.

1069	Q:28793A:45885	Could allergy induced asthma turn in COPD? If Asthma is poorly treated  it is possible for the changes - which are typically reversible in Asthma - to be permanent. So  make sure your Asthma is under the best control. Uncontrolled persistent asthma causes airway remodeling that can slowly progress to emphysema (quicker in smokers and people with severe reflux). Treatment of underlying conditions can deter that from happening. Asthma  COPD  Allergies  Hypersensitivity Asthma  Emphysema  Reflux  COPD  Allergies  Hypersensitivity

1072	Q:43282A:186433	Do most kids outgrow asthma? Many physicians who treat asthma avoid calling a child an asthmatic patient until they are about 5 years old. This is because viral infections may cause wheezing in younger children. Viral respiratory infections will not usually cause wheezing in adults or older children unless they have an underlying asthma problem. Many kids who wheeze before age 5 often appear to outgrow their   asthma  . Necessarily . The current thinking is that asthma changes over your lifetime. This is a tricky issue with confusion over labels in infancy  that are imprecise. Many kids with wheezing issues as infants & toddlers come by them with infection triggered events that respond to asthma medications. Some use the asthma label for these kids without further testing. More than half will quit having wheezing events after age 5.So your answer depends on how you use the label. Outgrowing asthma is a slightly controversial topic; while some adults who had asthma as a child do not have symptoms as an adult  objective measurements of lung function often find problems in these individuals.  It is not clear if there is truly a lessening of the disease  a decrease in activity  or tolerance (or some combination of all three) that leads to the phenomina.

1073	Q:88118A:146112	How can you avoid asthma? Developing asthma is not always in a person's control. Allergies can happen no matter what you do as can airway inflammation. Asthma can occur in non-smokers but smoking can lead to airway inflammation so smoking needs to be avoided. Avoiding allergy triggers is also necessary. Good luck!!! That's right. 50% of asthma risk you get from your parents. If you choose ones with allergies or asthma you are already at high risk. Tell your parents not to smoke  especially when mom is pregnant with you. Tell them to get a dog and a cat before your birth. That helps. Don't live near roads with heavy diesel traffic. Avoid wood smoke & damp homes. Get exercise  sunshine & eat lots of fish. Asthma  Smoking  Child allergies  Inflammation Asthma  Normal childbirth  Pregnancy  Exercise  Child allergies
1074	Q:294559A:423773	what is good to help control asthma? Triggers are things that set asthma off.  If your asthma is set off by smoke  then avoid environments where you might be exposed.  If you're allergic to pets  avoid those.  If dust mites are a problem  mattress covers help.   For best results  an allergist can help you find out exactly what your triggers are.  Medicines that reduce inflammation and open the airways help control remaining symptoms. once persistent asthma has been disgnosed  the primary controller is an inhale steroid. This can reduce your need for a rescue inhaler (alberterol) as well as reduce your visits to emergency depts. Pets  Inflammation  Mite  Asthma Asthma

1079	Q:247268A:391898	Can asthma return? Many would never use a single episode of wheezing as a true indication of asthma. An early  simple definition of asthma is:  recurrent episodes of wheezing or bronchospasm  not always triggered by an infectious process  . Single episodes can occur in response to toxic gas exposure  infection or other triggers in anyone. In some cases from infancy  asthma improves or   disappeared   & then returns or became more symptomatic as an adult.It can happened at any age. If a young adult smokes it could developed in COPD with more chances than in others It is not unusual for a patient to have a history of asthma as a child/teen have the symptoms resolve and then return as an adult.

1081	Q:81099A:130180	My mom gets asthma  so am I likely to get it later? Asthma is not considered a genetic disorder but if you are exposed to the same environmental triggers and have a predisposition for asthma  you may indeed develop it. Asthma can occur at any age so if you develop symptoms  especially if similar to your mother's  see your doctor for evaluation and treatment. Be sure to avoid smoking as well. Asthma is your mother increases your likelihood of getting asthma.  About 30% of children with one parent with asthma will also develop asthma. The fact that your mother has been diagnosed with asthma makes it more likely for you to develop asthma. In fact  maternal asthma is probably the most important risk factor for developing asthma. However  you should not assume that you will develop asthma because of your family history. The diagnosis of asthma is based on symptom history (cough  wheeze  shortness of breath) and lung function tests The genetics of asthma & allergies are complex and not simple like eye color.Asthma varies from unrecognized to deadly by 1 year of age.My mom never wheezed until >70 sisters had it as kids  brother never had sx & I have a mild cough varient.If both parents have asthma your risk is higher. Most disabling asthma in males is evident the first yr & by 4 in females.It is quite treatable if respected. If one parent has one of the atopic diseases- asthma  eczema or allergic rhinitis  then 1/3 -1/2 of their children will probably be affected as well.  If both parents are allergic then 2/3-3/4 of the children will be affected.

1082	Q:35452A:26825	How does asthma affect pregnancy? It is very important to maintain good control of asthma during pregnancy.  This means that even category C medications  if required to maintain good control  should be continued during pregnancy.  The risks of depriving oxygen to the fetus versus with uncontrolled asthma outweighs the risks of a possible negative effect to the fetus from the medications.  Always consult with your doctor first. It is important for both mother and baby that the asthma remains under good control  and this can be achieved with medications. Pulmicort and Singulair have Category B ratings for pregnancy.It is reported that approximatley 1/3 of pregnant asthmatics improve  1/3 worsen and 1/3 remain the same.

1094	Q:64286A:93048	my son has serve asthma on 2xsertide 6xatrovent6xsalbtomol1xsingular with all this he still gets breathless could he need oxygen? Your son obviously has breathing problems but your medication description is very confusing. He obviously needs to be seen by an asthma or pulmonary specialist. But the first thing is to make sure you are using the medications currently prescribed for you correctly. Many patients are confused by which med to use when. See your primary doctor or call them immediately if u r unsure of his meds Your child is on many medications  some of which are rescue meds and some are maintenance medications.  Sounds like he/she needs an evaluation by a pediatrician  allergist or pulmonologist  who is  comfortable managing moderate persistent to severe asthmatics and can teach you how to use a Home Asthma Action Plan based on Peak Flow readings that you do 2 times a day at home to determine which meds Your son is taking Seretide (=Advair) 2x/day  Singuilair  salbutamol(=albuterol) 2x/day & Atrovent 6x/day. That's a lot of medication. His reliance on reliever medications (salbutamol & Atrovent) several times a day means asthma in not well-controlled. In the U.S. if your son were >12 years of age he would be a candidate for Xolair therapy. For asthma oxygen therapy is used only in emergencies. Not likely.  He should see a qualified Allergist/Immunologist who can help treat your son.  Oxygen does not have a role in the treatment of Asthma chronically  only during an acute episode requiring hospitalization.  Most asthmatics who get   breathless   are not getting the right set of medicines  are not inhaling them properly  or have an additional/other diagnosis.  Seeing a specialist will help.

1095	Q:88176A:200496	When a girl has asthma  what are the effects? The major gender difference in asthma is that it affects more boys than girls and more women than men. In other words  on average asthma begins in females at a later age than in males. Also  adult women often have the most severe asthma that is more difficult to treat. usually recurrent wheezing or coughing with viral upper resp infections.  depending on severity  may need preventative meds. Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing  shortness of breath and cough due to bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Between episodes most asthmatics are symptom-free. There are effective meds to treat the exacerbations. If your symptoms are severe during an episode  go to the ER for treatment. Refrain from smoking to minimize the airway inflammation.

1098	Q:268961A:419194	How effective is flovent compared to adviar for asthma? Works the same and different.  Advair is fluticasone (Flovent) with another medicine called Salmeterol which is a long acting bronchodilator.  Advair is used as a maintenance medicine with the addition of the long acting bronchodilator to help keep the smooth muscle in the airways relaxed and thus keep the airway open.  It is not to be used for acute issues - that is what Albuterol is for. Advair is Flovent plus Serevent (salmeterol) so Flovent is naturally somewhat less effective. If it is enough to control your asthma  stick with Flovent. There has been a lot of controversy about salmeterol actually increasing the risk of death. That and its benefits have to be balanced carefully. Asthma  Albuterol  Fluticasone  Salmeterol  Bronchodilator  Muscle  Smooth muscle Asthma  Serevent  Salmeterol
1099	Q:28862A:152884	What could happen if asthma is left untreated? Untreated asthma can worsen to the point that you end up on a ventillator or even die.  I've personally disconnected the ventillator after declaring brain death for a child with out of control asthma.  It was a very sad day. Untreated asthma could lead to sudden death  although usually a prolonged period of gradual worsening of airway obstruction leading to changes in the lung that cause permanent airway obstruction.

1101	Q:15961A:202255	If I have asthma must I use an inhaler? Most pts with asthma have a rescue inhaler for symptom control.  However  many asthma cases are mild enough that regular inhaler use is not required  especially if you can avoid various triggers that might exacerbate your symptoms (pollens  dust  animal dander  infections  etc). Asthma can vary from mild intermittent(<2 X/month)in which inhalers are used infrequently to severe persistent(frequent).If you have known triggers such as dust  pollen  cat dander etc  limiting your exposure can limit your need for inhalers.Some only need inhalers prior to exercise or cold exposure. Shortness of breath  chest tightness  and wheezing are 3 signs that you need your inhaler. If you are referring to daily inhalers  these are required for those using their rescue inhalers (albuterol) more than once weekly.  If you don't use your rescue inhaler that often  a daily inhaled medication  i.e. Advair or Symbicort  is not required. Inhalers work much faster than medications that you swallow. The doses are a lot lower because they go directly to the lungs. That makes them safer. If using an inhaler is hard to do adding a valved holding chamber  like a Vortex or Aerochamber  will help. Your physician  nurse or certified asthma educator can help with inhalers. Ultimately  there are oral alternatives if that is your preference. Most people with a true diagnosis of asthma do utilize or at least have a   rescue   inhaler such as albuterol inhaled.  However  some utilize other medications such as oral singulair.  It depends on both the frequency and intensity of your symptoms  but having an inhaler is a very wise decision to protect your ability to breath in case of an episode of asthma. Asthma is an inflammatory disorder  and you should know your triggers.  Some people only need medications under certain conditions  (illness  cold  exercise)  and therefore need medication infrequently.  Some people require it daily and there are several treatments depending on your need.  Inhalers currently are the mainstay; with controllers (inhaled steroids) or immediate need (albuterol). Properly used  inhalers can be a very effective way to treat asthma.  However  there are oral medications that can also treat asthma.  These tend to be older and less favored as these must be   systemic   medications (they go throughout your body just to get to the lungs) where inhalers go directly to the lungs.  Why take an oral medication that goes to the heart when we want it to go to the lungs? If  pt has sx withactivities or daily living including cough at night People with asthma do not always require an inhaler.  There are 2 categories of inhalers: rescue and controller.  All asthmatics should ALWAYS carry a rescue inhaler (Albuterol) in case of a flare of symptoms which can happen anywhere at any time  but only need to use them for such a flare.  Other asthmatics may need to use a controller inhaler regularly and then the rescue inhaler as needed. You need a daily anti-inflammatory inhaler if you have persistent asthma.  That means that you have airway inflammation (swelling) that needs to be assessed by a bronchospasm evaluation that is done as a diagnostic procedure by board certified allergists.

1102	Q:256754A:364189	Could allergies and exercise induce asthma? Both can induce asthma flares. Allergies and exercise are 2 of the most common triggers for exacerbation of asthma symptoms.

1109	Q:484461A:714562	Can an infant have asthma? Why and how? Is it preventable? Infants can have asthma but depending on the age of the infant there may be other more likely things causing the breathing problem.  Sometimes X-rays are helpful as a first step.  Ho the child responds to medications also gives a clue.  Sometime the heart could be the cause of the breathing problem so the best advice is to get your child checked by your pediatrician. Many infants have predisposing factors such as Family history as well as a history of atopy or cows milk allergy. Some babies wheeze because they have reflux  others develop chronic wheezing problems secondary to infections such as RSV. Do not forget environmental factors such as second hand smoke and exposure to fumes. Get asthma like symptoms especially this time of year. Weather change  colds  live Christmas trees  scents  pollens etc can be triggers . Family history can be a factor too. Usually lungs get inflamed and the swelling tightens up the airway causing difficulty of breathing and wheezing. Cough suppressants make it worse. They are usually treated with a bronchodilator . Have your baby checked . Infants can have symptoms similar to asthma such as persistent cough  wheezing and increased work of breathing. The  baby should be evaluated by the pediatrician as many causes can create these symptoms beside asthma - infection  bronchomalacia  bronchiolitis and heart disease.

1112	Q:83047A:133598	how do you know if you are developing asthma? If you develop symptoms like wheezing  cough  shortness of breath  you may have asthma. But there are other disorders that can also lead to these symptoms. So  if you develop these symptoms  you need to be evaluated by your doctor and tests may be needed for proper diagnosis and treatment. If you experience acute shortness of breath  go to an ER as this could be life-threatening. Some of the presenting symptoms can be wheezing  shortness of breath (dyspnea)  and nighttime cough. Symptoms can often be triggered by sudden temperature changes  environmental exposures  exercise. Family history increases the risk. Coffee can decrease symptoms as caffeine is similar to asthma meds (but do not use for treatment!) You can have a PFT Pulmonary Function Testing to see whether or not you have obstruction to your airway and to see if you improve with bronchodilators. Go to Dr or a Pulmonary specialist. Symptoms of asthma may include: --Dry cough  especially at night or in response to specific   triggers   like allergens. --Chest tightness--Shortness of breath at rest or after exercise--Wheezingóa whistling soundówhen breathing out--Colds that settle in the chest or last for more than 10-14 days Asthma  Difficulty breathing  Cough  Wheezing  Breathing Asthma  Exercise  Caffeine  Difficulty breathing  Family history  Cough  Wheezing  Breathing Obstruction  Pulmonary function test  Bronchodilator  Asthma Chest pain  Asthma  Exercise  Difficulty breathing  Chest tightness  Dry cough  Cough  Wheezing  Chest  Allergen

1118	Q:15950A:28452	Can small children with asthma eventually be cured? While asthma is not technically curable  young children tend to   outgrow   their asthma  and might not need long term medication into adult life - not a guarantee  just a possibility. Children who develop symptoms in the first three years of life may be more likely to outgrow it than children who develop it later. Current medications do not seem to change a child's chances of outgroing the diease. Risk factors for persistent asthma include: parents with asthma  environmental of food allergies  and tobacco exposure.   Cured   suggests a permanent situation.  Some children with asthma can lose the asthma symptoms  but always carry with them the genetic predisposition to re-developing the symptoms of asthma at a later time.  Studies show that children with asthma fall into 3 categories: 1/3 get better  1/3 get worse  1/3 stay the same.  Treating the allergies (with shots) in allergic asthma can improve symptoms. Young children with   asthma   or reactive airway disease can potentially improve over time and no longer have as significant respiratory issues but I would not say that asthma can be   cured   nor truly   outgrown  .  If so  then the original diagnosis should be called into question. It depends on what is meant by asthma. 2/3 children under six wheeze with upper respiratory infections. Half will outgrow this problem. Risk factors for persistence include eczema  family history of asthma & allergy & cigarette smoking in the home. Several studies strongly suggest that allergy immunotherapy started at an early age & given in appropriate doses can prevent & even reverse asthma. Asthma is not a curable condition.  It is a treatable condition that may improve with maturation of the immune system and lungs.  The real question is  is it really asthma?  Since certain illnesses like RSV can cause asthma-like symptoms for up to 6 months   a diagnosis of true asthma requires more than 6 months of symptoms.  If a child gets over asthma it probably wasn't asthma to begin with. There is a difference between wheezy episodes in young children & the diagnosis of asthma. Wheezing can occur in children due to viral illnesses (RSV  common cold) prematurity  & environmental tobacco smoke. As the child's lungs grow  the wheeze abates. Asthma can start at any age. Cough is the most common symptom. High risk factors are an allergy  diagnosis & family (especially maternal) history. Occasionally  asthma is caused purely by allergic sensitivity. Allergy shots can turn off the production of allergic antibodies and have been shown to product long term remissions or   cures   in both nasal allergy and allergic asthma.

1119	Q:28766A:402805	Are air purifiers effective in preventing asthma attacks? In patients that asthma symptoms are worsened by dust and environmental allergens  air purifiers seem to work very well. I must qualify this answer. If the purifier has HEPA filters with a very fine filtration rating  most allergens like pollen  dander etc may be removed and a good result may be seen.

1120	Q:33227A:231243	Can asthma be prevented? An asthma patient has episodes of bronchospasm (airways tighten up) plus swelling of the airways & increased mucus. Inhalers like albuterol relax & open up airways; inhalers like Flovent (steroid) prevent or decrease swelling & mucus. Preventive medicines like Singulair can help. Avoid triggers such as pollen  smoke  etc... Many children outgrow their asthma  but may get an episode years later. Asthma is a syndrome - a collection of symptoms that we treat as a single disease as we don't know why it occurs.  Some things appear to reduce the risk of asthma (growing up with pets  growing up not in the city  not being a poor urban child)  but none reduce the risk to zero and many are not avoidable easily. Asthma exacerbations can be caused by allergic triggers and avoidance of these triggers will decrease the exacerbations. However  it is not always possible to avoid all known triggers and some episodes have no obvious associated triggers. So  asthma is not always avoidable.

1124	Q:20196A:49605	Can you get rid of asthma completely? Asthma is a condition of hyperactive airways that can be triggered by different causes that vary from person to person.  If the only trigger for your asthma is inhaling cat dander  and you remove the cat from your home  you may have very little asthma unless you encounter cats outside your home.  Most asthma can be very well controlled  however  either with medications or allergy desensitization. Because asthma has a genetic component to it  in most cases you can't get   rid   of or   outgrow   asthma  you can only control it. Remember  asthma is inflammation  and studies suggest that even when patients feel fine and have no asthma symptoms there is likely some underlying inflammation present  in the airways at all times.

1125	Q:54015A:67745	If you're an asthmatic  how can you tell the difference between an asthma attack and a panic attack? Shortness of breath is a scary sensation so  when a person is short of breath  they tend to be anxious. Conversely  during a true panic attack  a person may feel that they can't breathe. Therefore  the end result looks quite similar. You would need to be evaluated during the episode to determine which it is. (ex.If there is wheezing/desat  likely asthma whereas clear lungs/normal sat likely panic) Also keep in mind that many people with asthma will develop a panic attack at the onset of their asthma attack and the two can co-exist and be very hard to differentiate.  This is also true of elderly patients with COPD.  Often their COPD exaccerbation responds to an anxiolytic such as a benzodiazepine (in addition to ususal treatment) Asthma attacks and panic attacks share some characteristics - shortness of breath  chest discomfort  increasing heart rate & anxiety. Coughing accompanies these symptoms in asthma and is not usually present in an anxiety attack.

1126	Q:33295A:81160	How could I cope better with severe asthma? The more you know about your asthma  including your triggers and what to do during an acute exacerbation  the more in control of it you will be. Once you are in control of it  you will find that you are less worried and you will be better able to cope with it.  Many world class athletes have asthma so living a normal life with asthma is definitely possible. Good luck!! The best way to cope with severe asthma is to be evaluated by a Pulmonologist.  With the proper history and diagnostic evaluation  you and your doctor can formulate an appropriate maintenance regimen for treatment and develop an action plan for exacerbations.  There are many different options for treatment that are considered on an individual patient basis. Dr. Bezack is right: get specialty care. Fortunately both pulmonologists & allergists are trained to evaluate & treat patients with severe asthma. Allergists will also treat the atopic basis of the disease (95% in kids  50% in adults) including coexisting allergic problems. Coping also means taking better care of self  getting family & friend support  & addressing issues like depression & smoking. Asthma Asthma Asthma  Smoking  Depression  Children's health  Children

There are children who have true food allergies  not just intolerances.With asthma  these foods can trigger an attack. There are no specific food issues with asthma so allow him to eat anything within reason. To complemtn Dr. Fox's answer: In addition  anyone with esophogeal reflux (  heartburn  ) is at increased risk for asthma symptoms. To reduce the chances for reflux: besides trying to avoid obesity (which can contribute to reflux)  avoid clothing about the chest or waist that is too tight. Unless there are demonstrated food allergies (which usually are associated with hives and gastrointestinal symptoms)  no specific diet is required.

If by allergies you mean allergic rhinitis  search for the   one airway theory  .  Essentially  the nose and lungs are   connected  .  They both have very similar inflammatory reactions that can be triggered by an allergen  an irritant  or an infection.  In fact  one can usually influence the other: when having nasal symptoms  asthma symptoms are more likely in asthmatics. Asthma is inflamation in the lung.  Triggers cause muscles in the airway to constrict and cause asthma episodes.. Allergens like pollen  animal dander  mold spores and dust mite are one type of trigger.  Other triggers include cold air  exercise and infections like colds  sinusitis and ear infections.  Allergies can affect other areas in the body like eczema for the skin and heyfever for the nose.

1144	Q:302127A:430724	What can you expect from having asthma? ASthma can be intermittent (occurs every now and the or persistent. Persistent asthma can be mild moderate or severe (these relate to the frequency of attacks). With good controller adherence you can expect few attacks. In any case  see your physician and work out an asthma plan if needed. This can reduce your attacks dramatically. Asthma
1145	Q:8677A:150957	Do children outgrow their asthma? The majority (60-70%) of children who had recurrent wheezing episodes in early childhood   outgrows   by 6 years old. When they get older adolesent and teen it often becomes quiet(no asthma symptoms) but they can recur again later. so you don't really grow out of it. It becomes latent. This is an area of controversy in medicine. Statistically  there are many children with childhood asthma who grow up to not complain of symptoms; however it is not clear if they are just avoiding activity that incites asthma or are used to the symptoms and don't seek treatment.  So  it is possible to be an adult who had childhood asthma and be relatively symptom free.

1146	Q:61815A:90764	what is the treatment of acute asthma?? The first line treatment for cute asthma attacks  use of a bronchodilator medication like Proventil  Proair  Ventolin or Xopenex. In some case another medication called Atrovent  which is a different type of bronchodilator can be used as well. If these medications are not helpful in a short amount of time or the asthma attack is pretty bad then call 911 and seek medical care. Asthma can kill ! Acute asthma is treated with bronchodilator agents and anti inflammatory agents. Some patients also require supplemental oxygen  IV fluids  etc. If the exacerbation is very severe  the patient may need BiPAP or mechanical ventilation. Bronchodilators such as albuterol (Ventolin  Proventil) or Xopenex enlarge the diameter of the airways to help air flow and mucus come out of the lungs. Patients with cough-variant asthma  exercise-induced asthma  or regular asthma also use steroid inhalers (such as Flovent) to reduce swelling  mucus  and   sensitivity   in the airways. Singulair is an additional medication that can be started.

1148	Q:15957A:144822	How do I know if my child has asthma? Symptoms are wheezing and shortness of breath. I would refer you to our healthtaps pediatrician to give you further information. My practice is on adults only in surgery and self-healing meditation to treat cancers and chronic illnesses as a secondary support management of complementary medicine. Everything from allergic rhinitis to full blown asthma attack is because of your immune systems responce to your environment.  A lot of children present with constant runny noses and mom and dad don't notice the wheezing.  Later as the child is exposed to more allergens they notice that it gets more difficult to breath in certain situations like exercising  or when it gets cold. Wheezing...... History of symptoms tends to be very important in children.  Cough with exertion  laughing or crying  cough with URIs  wheezing  or cough at night  all can be clues to childhood asthma.  A physical exam helps and then as the child gets older  specialized lung function tests can be done to confirm the diagnosis.

1153	Q:188854A:278320	Is it possible to outgrow Asthma? Children who develop asthma/ alleges in the first year of life can outgrow it by the age of three. Those who develop symptoms later often have it for life. Puberty is the other time period where many people   outgrow   problems....... Sometime symptoms  reappear 20-30 years later. Asthma is a chronic disease that has no cure. But  some asthmatics have prolonged asymptomatic periods between exacerbations  sometimes lasting many years. However  there can be an acute exacerbation at any time. So  you can have no exacerbations once you are an adult   only to suffer an exacerbation later in life. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition in response to allergens & usually as one grows the diameter of airways also grows. One may not necessarily be outgrowing the asthma but as the airway get wider  the degree of obstruction decreases resulting in lesser degree of symptoms&at one point the person may not realize that he/she is wheezing. So some children seem to outgrow it. Many physicians label a lot of wheezing processes in infancy as asthma that may not be true asthma.Various lower respiratory viruses like RSV can bring out a transient wheezing tendency that disappears with age.Up to 75% of wheezy kids will not wheeze after 4-5y. This overlaps true asthma  the worst cases may present < 1y in males <4y in females & persist through life.

1158	Q:179329A:406949	What causes asthma to occur in children? of the autonomic (automatic) nervous system. These nerves are controlled by the lower brain and mild compromise of oxidation in the lower brain initiates it. In my hard won experience it is related to poor diet  particularly sugar stuff because that is the easiest way to compromise oxidation. See my blog   Oxygen  the Spark of Life   thatg you can Google. A very common cause of asthma in children are allergies. One of the common blood components found in the mucus/sputum of asthmatics (especially children) is related to allergies (eosinophils).  When we look at the   triggers   to asthma in children  they are often related to substances that cause allergies (ie animal dander  dust mites etc). There is ample evidence that true asthma is genetically linked to the issues of allergy & eczema & frequency is higher when one or both parents are affected. Lower respiratory tract viruses often trigger both infectious wheezing & that of true asthma early on with infectious wheezing subsiding after 3-4y. Allergies often co-exist but less than 5% of events are allergy driven alone.

1160	Q:640100A:961630	I was diagnosed with asthma. What do I do now? All patients with asthma should have an action plan that details which medications to take and how often  what to do if asthma symptoms occur  when to call the doctor and which asthma triggers to avoid.  It would be helpful to learn as much about asthma as possible so you can control it and it won't control you! Treatment of asthma depends on the severity and cause. For intermittent asthma (symptoms less than twice a week) an inhaler  such as albuterol  should be fine. This also can prevent exercise-induced asthma.  For more frequent symptoms inhaled corticosteroids and other medications are very effective. Allergen avoidance is also important. Asthma

1162	Q:20217A:46747	How can exercise trigger asthma? The simplest way to put it is that there is more demand on the lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise. That requires faster and deeper respirations and may strain all parts of the lungs. Exercise leads to mouth breathing because when you exercise you can't get enough air through your nose. The nose warms and moistens air; the mouth not so much. Cold  dry air irritates the cells that line the breathing tubes that in turn release biologic mediators that cause airway muscle cells to contract narrowing the breathing tubes causing coughing  wheezing & chest pain & tightness.

1166	Q:47284A:48771	What is in an asthma medication anyway? Inhaled asthma medications consist of a few drug classes: inhaled steroids (to reduce airway inflammation)  a beta agonist (to relax the muscles in the airway)  mast cell stabilizers (cromolyn sodium  which keeps allergic reactions from getting out of control)  leukotriene receptor agonists (which keep allergic reactions down as well)  anticholingerics  and oral steroids. It depends on the type of medication. Asthma rescue medications typically contain albuterol  a medication that relaxes smooth muscles that can tighten and narrow the airways. Other asthma medications contain anti-inflammatory compounds like inhaled steroids  while others work by stabilizing specific   allergy   cells called mast cells. There are many different types of asthma medications! Asthma  Cromolyn sodium  Steroids  Sodium  Agonist  Inflammation  Mast cell  Muscle  Receptor Asthma  Albuterol  Steroids  Muscle

1171	Q:200237A:298852	What kind of condition is asthma? Asthma by definition is chronic airway inflammation.You have two components   the chronic swelling or inflammation of the airway  and spasm of the airway  both things create narrowing  the swelling and the clamping down of the airway. When you have these 2 going on at the same time you also have an increased mucus production. You have to attack both components in order to achieve control. Asthma is characterized by reversible  recurrent bronchospasm accompanied by airway inflammation. It is not curable but it is very treatable and most patients are symptom-free between exacerbations.

Colds and coughs are common and most are not asthma related. The way to know is have your pediatrician check your child during these episodes of cold and cough. I'm sure your doctor will be able to tell. If your child gets lots of colds that   go to his/her chest   or the cough tends to last a long time whenever he/she gets sick  then that is more likely to be asthma. Definitely get them checked  as if so it should be treated to control the ongoing inflammation in their lungs.

Asthma can present in many ways  but typical symptoms are wheezing  difficulty breathing  a feeling as though you cannot push air out of your lungs and sometimes coughing.  If you notice your child having difficulty breathing it is important to see a doctor right away. Coughing and wheezing are common symptoms of asthma.  Wheezing is a sound made when exhaling (breathing out).  Symptoms tend to be caused or worsened by colds  flus  exercise  allergies  or rapid changes in the weather. The most common symptom of asthma is actually coughing.  Wheezing and shortness of breath are the symptoms most people expect to see  but coughing is actually the most common symptom.  Most children experience initial symptoms with colds (and although there are other reasons to cough with a cold); if colds typically   go to the chest   or chest symptoms last more than 10 days   think   asthma  . Symptoms of asthma include acute  recurrent shortness of breath accompanied by coughing and/or wheezing. Other symptoms depend on etiology and severity of the acute asthma exacerbation. Most asthmatics are  asymptomatic between acute episodes. asthma is inflammation of the airways  which can result in shortness of breath  wheezing  and/or coughing.  it can be caused by allergies  colds/pneumonia  smoking  or other causes.  if you think that you have asthma  you should see your primary care provider for definitive diagnosis and treatment.

1176	Q:171889A:248398	Can mucinex be taken for asthma? Guaifenesin is used to relieve chest congestion . Guaifenesin may help control symptoms but does not treat the cause of symptoms or speed recovery. Guaifenesin is in a class of medications called expectorants. It works by thinning the mucus in the air passages to make it easier to cough up the mucus and clear the airways. Best asthma meds: albuterol/corticosteriods. Mucinex is not an effective treatment for asthma. Though not helpful for your bronchial spasm  excessive mucous is produced with this condition. Mucinex is only used by some of use if the mucous gets too thick and discolored from a secondary injection. Mucinex is a medication to help liquify secretions.  If secretions are hard to raise  mucinex may be helpful as an adjunct.  It may be more helpful in treating COPD.

1181	Q:20198A:232490	I'm not sure if I have asthma. What does it feel like? Classically asthma patients complain of chest tightness  like someone is sitting on their chest.  It can feel like you are not   getting air to the bottom of you lungs   or I have even heard that their chest feels   itchy  .  I will occasionally have non-asthmatics breathe in and out of a coffee stirrer and then have them do jumping jacks  to simulate trying to breathe through a constricted airway. People with asthma symptoms typically feel some version of a   lack of air  .  This can include feeling chest tightness  like something wrapped around your chest; chest pressure  like someone sitting on your chest; wheezing  like a squeak or whistle noise from your chest  or generally   shortness-of-breath   where you feel out of breath like you just exercised (when you did not). Asthma is a disease characterized by acute episodes of bronchospasm and airway inflammation.

When the news reports poor air quality either due to high ozone or high pollen counts  then you should stay in as much as possible. See your doctor if your symptoms are poorly controlled. First  are you on medication? You should be taking an oral or nasal spray antihistamine &/or a nasal steroid steroid for allergic rhinitis  perhaps drops for your eyes. For asthma you should be taking a controller medication like an inhaled steroid or Singuliair & a rescue inhaler. Pollen counts are lowest in early morning before the dew rises & highest on hot  sunny  windy afternoons. The goal of management of allergic disease is that the patient should be able to do whatever they want. See an allergist  find out what you are allergic to and develop a treatment plan that may include antihistamines  nasal sprays and allergy vaccine therapy.

1188	Q:85837A:149271	Do lots of people get asthma  or is it unusual? Asthma is certainly increasing in prevalence  as are allergic diseases in general. I would not classify asthma as being   unusual  . Risk factors for developing asthma include family history of asthma  or personal history of eczema  food allergy  or seasonal allergies. Asthma is actually quite common so lots of people have asthma. Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood  affecting 9% of the pediatric population.  As many as 30% of children will have wheezing  not all of which is due to asthma.  Asthma is often missed in children. More then 30 million people in USA alone have asthma. More that 6 million are children. It is one the most common and chronic illnesses. 5 000 people die yearly from asthma attacks.

1190	Q:130710A:196925	how   to control asthma? Control of asthma involves avoidance of allergens and administration of rescue medications such as albuterol inhaler and/or inhaled steroids. There are many options to help control asthma  what is used depends on the age of the patient  the severity of the asthma and what works for the individual. It includes avoidance of triggers  inhaled bronchodialators  maybe inhaled steroids  possibly pills for allergies or to block the asthma like singulair  and other medications or inhalers. It is important to get it controlled  see your doctor! Avoiding things that trigger your asthma  such as dust or animals  can help. Most asthma is controlled with short acting inhalers like albuterol  & long acting inhaled steroids. Albuterol helps acute attacks; inhaled steroids help prevent attacks from happening in the first place. Other meds  such as Singulair or oral steroids  are used when these aren't enough to keep it under control.

1191	Q:64868A:114210	signs of asthma in imfant? It is uncommon for parents to hear wheezing in infants but can be heard by physician. Other signs of persistent asthma include prolonged cough- typically dry.  Symptoms of an acute asthma attack could be fast breathing  appearance of being short of breath  pulling of the respiratory muscles where you see indentation in the neck and chest wall with breathing and if present seek medical attention. Infants typically develop bronchiolitis which can be associated with asthma later in childhood.  Recurrent cough or wheeze can be signs of asthma  especially with a family history or exposure to common triggers such as cold  tobacco  smoke  animal dander and other allergens.  With infants some of the first signs involve feeding difficulties due to inability to coordinate breathing with sucking.

For maintenance treatment (to prevent flareups) it's hard to beat inhaled steroids (NOT anabolic steroids like athlete's use; THESE are anti-inflammatory instead!). Dose is very tiny since it goes straight to the lungs instead of through the body to get to the lungs-thus few if any side effects. Use a spacer device with any inhaler;it gives maximum benefit with least side effects. Feel better! From a medical perspective  inhalers exert most of their effect in the lung with minimal exposure to the rest of the body. As such  they are considered localized therapy.

1196	Q:315512A:1033884	What are the possible ways to prevent asthma among toddlers? There is no way to prevent an illness or disease. If you are going to get it  then it will happen. Best ways to try to help are a good diet  multivitamins  exercise (lungs and diaphragm are muscles)  and sometimes if the tonsils are enlarged they can make breathing mimic asthma True asthma is heavily influenced by your genetic makeup. If it is in your genes it will likely surface in some form during your lifetime (mom was 70 sis was 2 mine was teens).Toddlers sometimes wheeze from infectious triggers & I don't consider that true asthma. As many as 80% of them will grow out of it by 5. Avoiding & managing aggravating factors helps (smokers fumes airborn irritants) Asthma has a strong genetic component and is also more frequent in babies that have had RSV.  As far as prevention  give them a healthy life style  eat less processed foods  and don expose the airway to harsh inhaled chemicals.

1197	Q:43291A:28429	How can I tell whether or not this is asthma or just a seasonal thing? Asthma is recurrent episodes of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Seasonal allergies can be an etiology of asthma so you need to see a doctor to evaluate your symptoms to determine if you have asthma. Only rarely is asthma only seasonal. Allergic sensitivity caused by IgE antibodies can cause nasal congestion  eye irritation and bronchoconstriction. all patients with Asthma should have allergy testing to dust mites and pet dander (if there is a pet exposure)  since environmental modifications can reduce symptoms. Knowing what seasonal allergens are important to any person helps management. If testing is done to prove seasonal allergy sensitivity  this will help your physician manage your symptoms when the underlying cause is in doubt. If you have nasal congestion during spring tree pollenation  but allergy testing had shown you were not allergic to trees  then your physician would be more likely to prescribe medications to treat a viral   cold   or a sinus infection.

1224	Q:43769A:231253	What is asthma? Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the lungs that can cause constriction of the airways and causes shortness of breath  cough and wheezing and is usually treated with bronchodilators and antiinflammatory inhalers  and sometimes other medications are indicated depending on the severity of the disease. A pulmonologist or allergist can diagnose and treat it. Asthma can be thought of as your lungs getting too tight to get enough air in &amp; out  thus leading to characteristic wheezing &amp; shortness of breath. With that said  absence of wheezing doesn&#x27;t imply lack of asthma b/c asthma attack can be so bad that there&#x27;s no air movement  thus no sound. Breathing tubes can get smaller (bronchospasm) &amp; plug w/mucus due to inflammation. http://goo.gl/mxu8b Main components of asthma are inflammation and constriction of small airways  making  more difficult to breathe. When exposed  to virus or allergen  wheezing can occur.The more severe  inflammation and constriction  the worse the asthmatic attack. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual plugging up airways. Asthma affects people of all ages  but it most often starts during childhood. of  bronchi characterized by constriction iflamation and increased sputum production Asthma is a life-long breathing problem. It is caused by swelling and closing of the airways and can make it hard to breathe. You cannot see airways because they are inside the body  connected to the lungs. If your child has asthma and itís not treated  it could limit the activities your child can participate in  as well as her ability to feel well and be alert in school. Asthma is not one disease  but a collection of symptoms and problems that we treat similarly.  The main problem in asthma is inflammation (swelling) in the small air conducting units in the lung combined with spasm of those airways.  The problems is thought to mostly be caused by allergens in the air - but this may not always be true. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by recurrent acute exacerbations of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Between exacerbations  most asthmatics have no symptoms.

Some young children that wheeze have immature lungs and with growth the   non-asthmatic   wheezing clears. Other   pseudo asthmas   can clear with correct treatment. There is no cure for asthma but there are effective treatments to minimize symptoms.

1230	Q:194420A:288740	What is the capacity of asthmatic lungs vs non asthmatic lungs? Asthma is an obstructive lung disease- difficulty getting the air out.  Many asthmatics have normal lung function at baseline and only experience symptoms and diminished lung function episodically.  Some asthmatics do develop fixed changes in the airways  called airway remodeling.  These changes can range from mild to significant. Estimated Peak Flow is  based on Age and height. Usually it is approximately 450 L/min in a non asthmatic. Total lung capacity is the volume of air in the lungs at the end of maximal inspiration. Asthmatics can have higher lung volumes than normal people because their lungs become hyperinflated when they have attacks. They have trouble breathing all the way out  so the volume left over afterward  the residual lung volume  is also elevated. In severe asthmatics  fibrosis/scars can decrease volumes.

1233	Q:154546A:229743	What are the tests for adult asthma? The two main tests are spirometry  in which you blow hard into a computer sensor that measures how well your lungs work  and the Fractional Excretion of Nitric Oxide  which is a measure of the amount of inflammation in the lungs. Particularly in people younger than 50  allergy tests can help to diagnose the triggers for your asthma. To diagnose asthma  one needs to diagnose recurrent bronchospasm and airway inflammation. This can be done by a doctor based on clinical grounds (example: the doctor hears wheezing/coughing on more than one occasion and it resolves completely with treatment). Or  the diagnosis can be made in the pulmonary function lab if this diagnosis is suspected but the physical exam is normal.

1234	Q:648883A:993518	What would happen if a child has undiagnosed asthma? Asthma is a chronic illness that accounts for just under 5 000 deaths per year and 500 000 hospitalizations. If your child has the classic triad of cough  wheeze and shortness of breath  do not hesitate to get them in to your local allergist for therapy. The child may wheeze/ cough/ or just be breathless with activity or in response to fragrances or other triggers. Can also manifest itself as easy fatigabity with exercise. Asthma should not be life threatening but can be if it goes undiagnosed or untreated. Have your pediatrician evaluate the child ASAP! A kid could go through life & have mild forms of asthma & never visit an emergency room or suffer for lack of a label. Even those with mild disease would be prone to respiratory illness an an infant or child but 70%+ of wheezy infants can be asymptomatic adults.

1236	Q:93902A:155861	What are some methods that ease asthma? Identify triggers (allergies/get tested & irritants) - pursue targeted avoidance.  Establish an optimal anti-inflammatory regimen suitable for your current disease severity (see an Allergist) with potential for future step-down after demonstrating optimal disease control for at least 3-6 months. Breathing exercises/yoga can make you feel better but the above steps are crucial for disease control. Bronchodilator and steroid inhalers both serve to decrease asthma symptoms. Avoidance of allergy triggers is also important. Do not smoke and quit smoking if you do. Exercise with your doctor's input as some asthmatics need special precautions to exercise but exercise is helpful. Follow doctor's instructions.

1238	Q:20164A:32738	What allergies are associated with asthma? Inhaled allergens are more likely to trigger asthma than food allergens. Animal danders  especially cat dander  are significant triggers as are house dust mites & cockroach. Mite particles enzymes may break down the epithelial barrier in the breathing tubes leading to additional allergic sensitization. The mold spore Alternaria is thought to be the cause of thunderstorm-triggered asthma. Asthma is associate with allergy in 80% of children and 50% of adults.  The allergens that are associated with asthma are primarily those that we can breathe or the aero allergens.  This includes thing such as pollen  mold spores  animal dander  cockroach  and dust mite. Although common inhalant allergens (dust mites  cockroach  mouse  rat  cat  dog  mold  pollens) are most often the allergic triggers for asthma  in some cases food allergy can be the trigger of asthma episodes. While any allergies can be associated with and trigger asthma symptoms  there are 2 in particular which have been shown in the medical literature to be highly linked to asthma flares.  Cats allergies are by far the most associated with asthma  followed by cockroach allergies (most common in inner-cities).  Chlorine has also been associated with asthma  but it is not considered an allergy.

Things that happen during pregnancy can aggrave so it is important to treat: reflux  vomitting  expanding abdomen. The risk to the baby of not taking your asthma medications while pregnant is generally considered to be higher than any risks to the baby caused by the medications themselves. Mothers who took their medications had higher birth-weight babies  presumably because they oxygenated the growing baby better. Check with your asthma doctor and your OB about the best medications to use when pregnant. The treatment of asthma in pregnancy is the same as treating asthma if one is not pregnant.

1269	Q:47283A:186426	How dangerous are rescue drugs for asthma? Rescue medications like albuterol are analogs of epinephrine & norepinephrine  2 chemical hormones made by your body that have multiple effects stimulating lungs  heart  muscles & gut. Rescue drugs are chemically designed to have little effect on any organ other than the lungs. Overuse of rescue drugs may not be sufficient to control asthma. When use exceeds 2x/week you also need controller meds. The short-acting beta agonists (albuterol) do have some side effects like palpitations etc.but are relatively safe. The long-acting beta agonists (LABA) are recommended (alone) in COPD but not asthma. There have been links with severe side effects when LABAs are used without steroids. IN the US LABA are often available in combo with  steorids and used as a controller-not rescue Albuterol and the other rescue beta-agonists are generally safe.  You may get a rapid heart beat ... but it is better than dying of asthma or suffering.  The reason we like to minimize rescue inhalers is that they don't treat the underlying illness - airway inflammation.  Inhaled steroids do this well for most sufferers.

1277	Q:56433A:86317	Is there such a thing as allergic asthma  if so how do you treat it? Allergies are the most Common cause of asthma. An allergist helps evaluate this by taking a history  examining you   doing a breathing test and then probably doing skin testing. There are very good treatments which will then be discussed with you. Treatment is determined by severity.  Need a thorough evaluation by an allergy and asthma specialist. Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma. It is inflammation and narrowing of airways triggered by inhaled allergens such as dust mites  animal dander  pollen or mold. The first step in managing allergic asthma is to identify the triggers and avoid them. You may need allergy testing to find out what is triggering your symptoms. There are medications to treat symptoms and prevent symptoms. Intal (cromolyn inhaler) can also help to stabilize your mast cells and that can help stabilize your bronchioles reaction o the allergen. Medications to treat symptoms include short-acting beta agonists/rescue inhalers like ProAir HFA or Xopenex HFA  and maintenance medications to prevent or reduce further attacks include steroid/long-acting beta agonist inhalers like Advair Diskus and leukotriene modifiers like Singular. Your doctor will treat it based on how frequently you are experiencing symptoms. Allergy shots may be helpful.

1287	Q:36558A:186436	Is there a test to see if your child will have asthma? There is not a test that can predict asthma. Recent New England Journal articles discuss an interleukin pathway that  when altered  confers increased susceptibility to asthma. Asthma is multifactorial (multiple genetic and environmental factors)  so any one risk factor (allergies  smoking  exercise) doesnt explain all cases. The recent research finding has not translated into commercial testing but may do so in the future Your physician should talk to you and your child about her/his symptoms  examine your child  and may (based on this) order pulmonary function tests if your child is older than 5 and1/2.  These tests evaluate for blockage (obstruction) in the airway caused by inflammation; however  a negative test does not mean that asthma is absent and a positive test doesn't mean they have asthma.

1288	Q:1851A:1523	Why can't I get confirmation from my doctor that my baby has asthma? we don't like to label kids at such a young age.  most kids outgrow their R.A.D (reactive airway disease) which is basically a childhood asthma.  if symptoms persist once older  maybe by 4-5 yo then asthma might be more mentioned. In a young child certain temporary conditions may look like asthma but either resolve over time or respond to different treatment.  Bronchiolitis which is most ofter cause by RSV virus can result in repeated episodes of wheezing usually after upper respiratory which can persist for several winters.  Gastroesophageal reflux may cause repeated wheezing which would respond to acid reducers Usually  the diagnosis is confirmed over time.  This is because   asthma   means a child has repeated episodes of asthma symptoms over time.  So  doctors often don't want to label a child as being   asthmatic    if the child had only one mild episode of asthma symptoms. Many infants have predisposing factors such as Family history as well as a history of atopy or cows milk allergy. Some babies wheeze because they have reflux  others develop chronic wheezing problems secondary to infections such as RSV. Do not forget environmental factors such as second hand smoke and exposure to fumes.   Yet it does not mean your child will be an Asthmatic. Asthma is a difficult diagnosis to make in young children.  Up to 40% will have occasional wheezing with respiratory infections that resolve as the child gets older. Many docs will avoid diagnosing asthma in young children for this reason. Also  spirometry or breathing tests cannot be performed accurately until about 4 years of age. Recurrent wheezing beyond age 6 is more likely to be asthma. The diagnosis of asthma is best established with lung function tests that are not feasible in babies.  However national guidelines from the NIH do give some criteria: recurrent episodes of wheezing troublesome cough at night cough or wheeze after exercisecough  wheeze or chest tightness after exposure to airborne allergens or pollutantscolds ìgo to the chest??or take more than 10 days to clear.

1290	Q:79396A:135277	What is Heberden's Asthma? Congestive heart failure might cause shortness of breath  cough and wheezing  which are symptoms characteristic of asthma. Heberden's asthma is commonly known as cardiac asthma. It is wheezing  coughing and shortness of breath that mimics asthma but is actually due to congestive heart failure. Symptoms are due primarily to accumulation of fluid in the lungs from a weak pumping action of the heart. The treatment is diuretics and additional medications that improve the strength of cardiac muscle contractions.

1293	Q:332415A:464054	What are side effects of  xopenex inhalers for asthma? Xopenex or lev-albuterol is a quick relief bronchodilator.  Side effects are typically mild and short lived.  They can include tremor  jitteriness  and increased heart rate.  Some studies suggest these side effects are less than albuterol.  The side effects can also depend on the dose. For the most part  you may experience temporary jitteriness that usually lasts for 15-20 minutes after taking it. This is because the medication causes an increase in heart rate. You may want to consult your physician prior to taking this if you have any heart problems. This is the most common side effect.

1296	Q:33478A:231235	What exactly happens during an asthma attack? An asthma patient has episodes of bronchospasm (airways tighten up) plus swelling of the airways & increased mucus  causing difficulty breathing and creating wheezing noises. Inhalers like albuterol relax & open up airways; inhalers like Flovent (steroid) prevent or decrease swelling & mucus. Many children outgrow their asthma  so are almost   cured   but may get an episode years later. The smaller air carrying tubes in the lung become inflamed and the muscles around them spasm.  This leads to air getting trapped out in the lung  so it becomes hyperinlated.  As a result  the sufferer can not get air out ... Or in.  If severe enough and untreated this can lead to death. During an asthma exacerbation  the inflammatory cascade in the airway is triggered leading to bronchospasm and airway inflammation. The airways become swollen and fill with inflammatory by-products like white blood cells  mucous  etc. Treatment is aimed at relieving the bronchospasm and inflammation.

1297	Q:52896A:68196	What types/breeds of dogs or cats would be the best option for someone with allergies and asthma? Cats are more problematic in that allergen is contained in dander  hair  saliva  and urine in high amounts.  Dogs differ somewhat also in the fact that the breed of dog determines the amount of shedding and dander.  In general work dogs like shepherds  labs  etc.. tend to dander more in order to keep their skin healthy.  Other non-working breeds dander less. If you have a specific allergy to dogs and/or cats  the best advice is not to have one. There is a misconception that dogs with hair that don't shed are   hypo-allergenic; however  the allergen comes from the animal's salivary glands. The pets clean themselves by licking and the allergen gets on there hair  fur  & skin. This is also why a reaction is worse when the pet licks you.

If your child is already vaccinated with the standard list  many pneumonia causing bacteria are covered and the other vaccine you are probably referring to    Pneumococal   is not needed for asthmatic children.  Also  unfortunately  because asthmatics trap air  they are more prone to pneumonia than the normal population. There is a vaccine to immunize against many strains of pneumococcal bacterial infection. It has been a routine immunization for children for about the last 10 years. Therefore depending on your child's age she may have already received it. Check her records.

1323	Q:626264A:939153	What is the etiology & pathology of asthma in layman terms? Inflammatory cells enter the lining of the airways in response to a variety of stimuli including allergies  dust  exercise  perfumes  etc.  these cells cause the airways to become very sensitive and narrow (Bronchoconstriction).  As air passes through the narrowed airways you become short of breath or wheeze The small airways in your lung are lined with muscles which help your body direct air to the right areas of the lung. In asthma these muscles all contract which makes it hard to get air out of the lung. The wheezing is the sound of air rushing thru the narrow passages. There can be many triggers to this event including stress or allergies. Asthma pathology is ongoing inflammation (swelling  mucus) in the small airways of the lungs  twitchy airways that constrict leading to cough and wheezing.  Asthma is more common in people with allergies  children exposed to cigarette smoke  children who had RSV virus  low birth weight preemie infants  certain occupations with chemical/allergen exposure. Exact etiology is still being investigated. Asthma  Pathology
1324	Q:670326A:1030167	How many types of asthma are there? Asthma is a diagnosed made based on symptoms and objective findings on lung function tests and is pathologically defined as inflammation of the airway lining and constriction of the muscles in the airways in response to triggers such as allergens (pollen  dust mites  pet dander  mold)  chemicals  viruses  cold temperature  exercise  etc to name a few..

1325	Q:641574A:965914	Can you tell me if foster 100/6 is good  for asthma thanks? this European combination of a steroid and long acting beta agonist is very similar to product in the US called SYmbicort (the steroid is different but works the same way). Asthmatics who require steroid   controller   therapy but also benefit from long acting agonist therapy (usually moderate to severe asthma) can be candidates. Foster 100/6 is a combination inhaler containing beclomethasone and formoterol.  This drug is undergoing clinical trials currently for treatment of COPD.  While this particular combination is not currently available in the US  both it's components are available and similar combination medications are used commonly for treating asthma.  Based on this I would say  YES  this would be good for asthma Asthma
1326	Q:82130A:131929	At my last check up  I forgot to tell the doctor about asthma.  Is that ok? It is ok if you forgot to tell your doctor about asthma to let your doctor know at your next appointment. If you don't have a follow-up appointment  be sure to make an appointment before your asthma meds run out to discuss your asthma symptoms  how well-controlled your asthma is  etc because your doc may want to do some testing first to insure you are on the best regimen possible at this time. 5 000 deaths/year and 500 000 hospitalizations for asthma attacks per year. Even just call and update the office with this information. And you need to see an asthma specialist to ensure you are fully controlled. Don't wait until something bad happens It would be helpful if your doctor knew about your asthma.  You may need medications for it and your physician should know which medications you are on.  I suggest you contact the doctor's office and let them know about your asthma. Asthma
1327	Q:853825A:1232426	What is the nature of asthma? Asthma is an inflammatory condition usually brought on by allergies  pollution  exercise cold weather and emotional swings.

1328	Q:80407A:129142	Will bronchial asthma kill me? Asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening and even fatal. So  it is imperative that you have a plan that your doctor has reviewed with you regarding what to do for sudden onset of your asthma symptoms. If you develop acute shortness of breath  go to an ER ASAP (call 911  if necessary)  so that your symptoms can be treated quickly and monitored to avoid a life-threatening or even fatal outcome. I've personally disconnected the ventilator for a brain dead bronchial asthmatic or two.  if you don't try to take care of the disease it absolutely can kill you. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs that if left untreated can be fatal. Even patients with asthma and under good control and treatment are at risk for severe asthma flares that can be fatal. Asthma is a lable applied to a disorder with a broad range of intensity from very mild to life threatening.One kid I managed almost died several times in childhood but now lives a good life as a coach with good control.I have lived with mild asthma for decades & rarely need any Rx.If you learn to understand the disease  respect it & manage it U can live well  if not it can surely kill you.

1333	Q:76744A:225477	is asthma a disability? Asthma can be a disability depending on the severity of the asthma. Asthma is extremely common  meaning lots of Americans have it. There is no perfect person  so everybody now or later has some sort of health issue. So  we cannot label a disease as a disability  because that would mean every one of us is disabled. For almost all disorders  there is a wide range of severity . . . and only the severe cases are labeled as disabilities. Asthma is a disease characterized by recurrent episodes of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. However  between episodes  most patients are completely asymptomatic. It is a very treatable disease and does not result in disability even though it is not curable.

1343	Q:8330A:63260	Lung Infection with Sever Asthma? Recent studies have shown that asthmatics who employ inhaled steroids have an increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia. Severe asthma reduces clearance of mucous and microoganisms (viruses & bacteria) from the lung. Long-standing severe asthma may lead to structural changes in the airway that compromise mucous clearance even more. Poor clearance of mucous & microorganisms from the breathing tubes is a clear risk factor for bronchitis and pneumonia. In children the leading risk factor for pneumonia is asthma.

1366	Q:177740A:259604	Side effects of prednisolone for asthma? Prednisolone is a steroid used to shut down inflammation that causes asthma symptoms  trouble breathing  etc. Used infrequently in short bursts  it can cause mild behavioral changes  agitation  and hyperactivity. Over time  with repeated use  it can cause a decrease in growth  fat deposition  acne  and bone thinning. Prednisolone is usually given to patients with an acute asthma exacerbation that is not improving with bronchodilators and inhaled steroids alone. The general course is 3 - 7 days. Over that period of time one can expect possible side effects to include: emotional lability  increased appetite  weight gain (mainly from water retention)  aggressive behavior.

1367	Q:33341A:153003	How will I know if my job worsens my asthma? If you notice that your asthma symptoms are suddenly worse when you start a new job  then this should be considered. If you notice that your symptoms are worse during the week and improves when you have time away from work  then work triggers should be considered. Unfortunately  it is not always this clear cut. Allergy testing is sometimes needed to assess for work-related triggers. If your job makes your asthma worse you'll generally notice increased coughing  wheezing  chest tightness and difficulty breathing while working. Sometimes asthma symptoms are worse during nighttime hours after working. You should feel a lot better after a few days off  even better after a long weekend  and best after vacation. If your symptoms are worse at work  and worsen over the work week while improving when at home for any period of time you and your physician should consider occupational asthma.

1369	Q:20205A:63211	What causes asthma? People with asthma usually are predisposed to be allergic. This is usually inherited  and so caused by your particular genes. However  this alone is not enough. There is also clearly an effect from the environment you live in. Exactly what in the environment is responsible is unknown  but is the object of much interest and research. While 80% of asthma patients have allergies  there are patients whose asthma starts after they had a respiratory infection. Those infections can be due to viruses such as influenza (the real flu) or certain bacteria such as Mycoplasma or Chlamydia. Such patients are usually older and have no history of allergy. Still  patients who already have asthma and get infected  their asthma will get worse. Asthma  Genetic  Gene Asthma  Influenza  Child allergies  Infection  Virus  Bacteria

1372	Q:88158A:145564	What are the effects of asthma? can be very dangerous with the most ominous result being hypoxia  which is not in taking enough oxygen into your body.   This is why prevention and control of asthma attacks is such an important part of an asthmatic's regimen. Long-term  in certain susceptible individuals  asthma can cause your tissue which surround your airways to scar  this is known as   remodeling   and is irreversible. Asthma leads to bronchospasm and inflammation so patients with asthma experience shortness of breath  cough  wheezing  etc. Asthmatics have exacerbations and between episodes they are often symptom free. Meds are given to decrease sxs and allow for longer symptom-free intervals and some asthmatics can go for months or even years between exacerbations.

1374	Q:482226A:677050	What is the definition or description of: Asthma inhaler? ASthma inhalers deliver drugs directly into the lungs. there are basically 2 types. Controllers which are usually cortisone type drugs which control the frequency of asthma attacks. The other is called a rescue inhaler to be used when you have an attack. Depending on the type of asthma you may need one or both types. An asthma inhaler could be a bronchodilator or a steroid designed to open the lungs.  It could come in a pressurized canister  via a nebulizer or via a dry powder inhaler. An asthma inhaler is a devise that delivers asthma medication through inhalation. They are sometimes called Puffers or MDI's (metered dose inhalers) They can deliver rescue medications such as albuterol  or controller medications such as inhaled steroids.

1377	Q:544076A:981301	How to tell if I have asthma? Do a pulmonary function test wait 15 to 20 minutes after inhaling a bronchodilator and the repeat the test. The test must be done according to American Thoracic Society guidelines and you use maximum effort to do the test. No bronchodilators should be used beforehand to throw the test off. The doctor will then tell you if you have asthma and will correlate this with your history and physical exam. Asthma is a clinical and spirometric diagnosis.  Histamine or methacholine challenge may be very helpful if testing is not clear.  All that wheezes is not asthma.

1379	Q:43774A:177421	What is an asthma attack? Any time your child has asthma symptoms  it is an attack. Some attacks end quickly. Others are serious. An attack is bad if: The child has trouble breathing  walking or talking  lips or fingernails turn blue or gray  or these symptoms get worse even after taking medication. If these things happen  call 911! An asthma   attack   is an acute exacerbation of asthma caused by bronchospasm and inflammation of the airways. These exacerbations are recurrent but patients are often completely normal between attacks. Symptoms during the episode include wheezing  coughing  shortness of breath. Patients may have low oxygen levels during the attack. Patients with these symptoms need immediate eval Lips  Breathing  Gray  Asthma  Walking  Fingernails Asthma  Bronchospasm  Difficulty breathing  Cough  Wheezing  Oxygen  Breathing  Hypoxia  Inflammation

1381	Q:20215A:60559	How is asthma triggered by dust? dust and dust mites can trigger allergies which in turn trigger asthma. In many asthmatics  dust is an allergen which means the inflammatory cascade in the airways is triggered by the dust resulting in bronchospasm and inflammation  the hallmarks of an asthma exacerbation. Treatment with bronchodilator and steroid inhalers are usually effective in controlling symptoms. Also thick particulates in the air can trigger asthma without allergies  such as a dust cloud.

1382	Q:8668A:61867	What Do I Do If I Have an Asthma Attack? This is a question that you need to address with your doctor. The answer depends on the severity of your asthma both at baseline and during acute exacerbations. Some patient's are instructed to take extra medicine while others need to report to the ER immediately. Please discuss this with your doctor so that you have an action plan in place before you have an acute episode. This can be life-saving Use your rescue inhaler.  If symptoms are not relieved or return  see your doctor.  If you have symptoms that require a rescue inhaler more than twice a week  your asthma is poorly controlled and you need an increase in controller meds like a corticosteroid inhaler. Hopefully  you have a written plan for those situations. You use your rescue medications (inhalers) and may also possibly need steroids for a few days. If your bronchodilators do not provide relief  you may need to call your doctor or 911. Asthma Asthma  Corticosteroid drug Asthma  Steroids  Bronchodilator
1383	Q:874138A:1252273	What should i do for my daughters asthma attacks? Asthma can usually be controlled if you develop a plan that deals with daily needs and recognizes pre-event signs before they trigger an attack.A good evaluation by your PCP with a written out plan if needed will control most.It usually incorporates a daily maintenance medication and symptom observation with added meds if coughing or wheezing appears.

1389	Q:20206A:44074	How do you diagnose asthma? Asthma is characterized by recurrent bronchospasm characterized by wheezing  coughing and shortness of breath. If you are examined by a doctor during an exacerbation and wheezing is diagnosed  and this occurs repeatedly  then the diagnosis can be made. Pulmonary function testing can also help with the diagnosis if necessary.Your physical exam and PFTs will be normal between episodes. Asthma is a respiratory condition diagnosed by compatible symptoms in a person who demonstrates airway obstruction on a breathing test that improves after a medication to open airways (albuterol).  If symptoms are suggestive (chronic cough  wheezing  shortness of breath  typically worse at night) and criteria are met on a breathing test  then asthma can be definitively diagnosed.

1390	Q:626078A:938620	If my dad has asthma  is the chance of my children being born with it hightened? A positive family history for asthma can increase the chance of a future child having asthma  but it doesn't assure that it will happen.  Be sure to let your children's doctor know of the positive family history so that they can be on the lookout for symptoms of asthma that might otherwise be written off as   just another cold  . There is a  generic factor  but it is only a part of his genetic make up. asthma and allergic disorders are partially influenced by genes  your kids may or may not have them depending on your spouse's genes too. The environment plays a role in the development of the disease  so it is a complex issue to predict. Asthma  Children  Child Health
1391	Q:124988A:194232	What expectorant is good to release phlegm in asthma? Same as those for people without asthma.  You want to make sure you don't use an airway irritant.  The one to stay away from with asthma or reactive airways is mucomyst.  Expectorants such as dextromethorophan are good and OTC. Guaifenesin is the only expectorant that does anything  but it isn't very effective. The bigger concern is that there is enough inflammation in the lungs to be producing a lot of sputum. The way to manage that is to identify the allergens triggering the asthma and treat the inflammation so the phlegm doesn't get produced in the first place. See a board-certified allergist.

Reactive airway disease is a more general term that includes asthma  but also other conditions that can present with wheezing or shortness of breath.  In older children and adults  reactive airway disease is usually asthma. More and more we are shying away from using that term. It is usually used to label very mild asthma that flares up very infrequently  usually due to a well-defined trigger like infections  wheather change  pollen  etc.  There's a reason asthma meds like albuterol are used for this.

1395	Q:58725A:88821	what is skin asthma? Some physicians in Israel (& perhaps elsewhere) refer to eczema during infancy as   skin asthma  . The reason? A large percentage of children developing eczema before their first birthday will also develop asthma by the 4th birthday. Referring to eczema as skin asthma draws attention to this phenomenon and possibly helps prepare the family for the next phase. It's a form of skin allergy called eczema  also called atopic dermatitis. It manifests as red scaly patches anywhere in the body.

1396	Q:43318A:28225	Should a child with asthma sleep in a basement? Basements may be more damp and have mold etc which can exacerbate the child's asthma. However  if the basement is appropriate for living and it can be made environmentally appropriate for an asthmatic (ie no rugs  vinyl/leather furniture  controled humidity  absence of c ats  dogs etc) this may be a good alternative. Please discuss with the child's pediatrician. Although the particular environment of your basement is not known  in general  it is not a good idea for children with asthma to sleep in a basement  especially on the floor.More humid environments promote much more dust mite and mold growth.

1397	Q:82287A:131915	How come I have bronchial asthma  but nobody else in the family has it? Asthma is not a genetic disorder  per se  so it entirely possible for you to be the only family member who has it. Asthma can be allergic or intrinsically induced (for example post-infection). Although there is no cure  there are many treatments available to keep you as free of symptoms as possible. You can have Bronchial Asthma without having a family history of it There are multiple genes involved in the bronchospasm control mediators involved in asthma. Your siblings obviously have different genes as did your parents & all may have bits of the genetic info but not enough to be symptomatic. They may have milder forms like cough varient asthma that are often unrecognised. 3 of 4 in my family had forms of it  1 had no sx ever. Asthma certainly has genetic factors but there are many other factors that may be involved in developing asthma.  These include allergies  infections  the environment  personal habits (e.g. smoking)  and many others.

1399	Q:172122A:248209	Does aminophylline cure asthma? In the 1960s &1970s  theophylline was a popular option for the treatment of chronic stable asthma  largely because of the disadvantages of alternative therapies. Theophylline has potential toxic side effects  necessitating monitoring of serum levels (blood test). Standard modern therapy now comprises of inhaled nebulized ?2 agonists (albuterol) and inhaled/systemic corticosteroids. Nothing   cures   asthma  but aminophylline is a medication that was used in the past as a first line treatment to relieve and prevent symptoms.  It still can be used  but with inhaled steroids and long acting broncodilators  it has fallen out of favor. No but may control the symptoms. It is not used these days as much as the past because it had more side effects than current therapy  which also seems to work better.

1404	Q:58011A:123427	Is there a correlation between asthma and eczema? Asthma and eczema are both allergic type disorders and many patients with one disorder will also have the other. Both are part of atopic disease.  Usually people who have one have the other. Treatment is also similar. Asthma  eczema  and allergies are all atopic diseases  where that part of the body is overrreacting to something that other people don't react to.  They can run in families but sometimes occur alone. There's no 'cure' but they can be controlled. Your doctor can work with you to find the best treatment regimen. Both eczema  and asthma can occur due to an allergic etiology.

1407	Q:33421A:50253	What are asthma spacers? Spacers are devices that are placed between the end of the inhaler and your mouth. You then activate the inhaler and inhale through the spacer to inhale the medication. There are many types of spacers available. The earliest spacers were styrofoam coffee cups attached to multidose inhalers used to help children get these drugs. Modern spacers are one-way valved holding chambers. Exhaled breath is expelled through side vents & doesn't reenter the spacer. Breathing in & out 6 times does not effectively deliver drug. Its better to breathe in slowly & hold the breath for 5-10 seconds. Kids can repeat twice. Spacers are devices to help one use a metered dose inhaler (MDI) correctly.  It can be very difficult for some people to use inhalers properly  especially young children.   One of the most common reasons someone might feel an inhaler is not helping their asthma is due to using the MDI incorrectly.  Spacers work as holding chambers between the inhaler and the patient to better inhale the med.

1412	Q:330954A:755044	What is the definitive test for asthma or c o p d ? Asthma and COPD (Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema) are constrictive lung diseases defined by a decreased ability to exhale air.  A physician  typically a Pulmonologist  can administer a flow spirometry test to measure the volumes of air during inspiration and expiration.  The hallmark of constrictive lung disease is a decreased FEV1/FVC  or a decreased volume during the first second of exhalation. Pulmonary function testing with bronchodilators. Spirometry is only a part of this. Complete PFTs give some more useful information  esp in COPD. Also  asthma doesn't always show up  you may need a methacholine challenge. Reversibility of airway spasm is the test. A 15 to 20% improvement in airway narrowing seen in FEV1 test after administration of a bronchodilator is considered the suggestive of asthma.  Lung tests (spirometry) showing airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC less than 70%) plus FEV1 less than 80% that is incompletely reversible after administration of bronchodilator is supportive of the diagnosis of COPD.

1413	Q:117792A:182259	Is bronchospasm major problem in asthma? There are two major components in Asthma  Chronic inflammation of the airways and Spasm. One feeds into the other  so if you do not treat both aspects you will not get very good results in your treatment.  You can not see inflammation  but you can hear and feel the spasm  the tightness  wheezing and Shortness of breath Bronchospasm and airway inflammation causes asthma exacerbations. Bronchospasm IS the problem in asthma. Bronchospasm means that muscle cells in the wall of the breathing tubes (known as a bronchus) contract i.e. go into spasm. This narrows the internal opening of the tube making it harder to move air in and out. It's like the feeling you get when blowing up balloons. This sensation of increased work of breathing & resultant fatigue is called dyspnea. Bronchospasm is the most important SYMPTOM in asthma - it causes the shortness of breath and all of the discomfort  etc associated with asthma. But the main problem is the underlying inflammation that leads to bronchoconstriction when exposed to allergens  odors and other irritants. The best long-term management of asthma is to treat the underlying inflammation.

1416	Q:95155A:158062	If you fail a pft does it mean you have asthma? Failing a pft could be due to different reasons  not necesarily due to asthma  your clinical history is more important than the pft to say if you have asthma  then the pfts  and sometimes we are not sure and have to wait or do other tests.   Failing   a PFT can mean the presence of obstruction like in asthma or COPD but there can also be restrictive lung disease which is caused by a whole lot of diseases including fibrosis  musculoskeletal disease  etc. There is also a diffusing capacity which could be abnormal due to many factors. So  not all abnormal PFTs mean asthma is present! Asthma  Pulmonary function test Asthma  COPD  Lung  Obstruction  Pulmonary function test
1417	Q:20204A:52699	How is asthma diagnosed? Asthma can be diagnosed on clinical grounds if your doctor hears you wheezing with a stethoscope on more than one occasion. Since most asthmatics have no symptoms between episodes  this is not always possible. Asthma can also be diagnosed with pulmonary function testing  including bronchoprovocation testing  if necessary  The patient history generally is the largest clue regarding the presence of asthma as the exam and pulmonary function testing are frequently normal.  If the patient is symptomatic  an irritant challenge can be diagnostic  but those tests are not perfect. Asthma involves inflammation  muscle spasm and mucus production in the airways. It is diagnosed by history  physical exam  and lung function testing. Patients often complain of chest tightness  wheezing  cough  and shortness of breath. It can occur in any age group  although it is the most common chronic illness in children.

1420	Q:28769A:257573	Are dehumidifiers considered effective in helping asthma and eczema sufferers? Dehumidifier - Yes! Humidifier - No. Dry air in your home reduces populations of house dust mites  a major allergic trigger of asthma & eczema. Skin moisturizing is accomplished by bathing in warm water followed by applying creams & ointments (not lotions) to trap water in skin. Humidifiers increase dust mite and mold populations. They are only useful for brief periods for the treatment of croup. Dry air often worsens eczema & asthma. As such  many patients find humidifiers (not de-humidifiers) to be helpful if they live with dry air. That being said  a too moist environment is not good since mold like to grow in overly damp areas. If you use a humidifier  make sure to clean the water reservoir in it regularly to prevent growth of mold in it. May be helpful depending upon your climate.  Eczema improves w a more moist environment. Asthma after worsens as moisture may breed mold which can irritate asthma.  Appropriate medications are much more effective in general.

1422	Q:130492A:196861	What are the symptoms of sports asthma in a child? Children with exercise induced bronchospasm often complain of cough  shortness of breath  and chest tightness or wheezing in the context of exercise. You might also notice your child not being able to   keep up   with his/her friends. Exertional asthma can cause wheezing and coughing and tighness in the chest. Taking albuterol before the activity can prevent this. You can also use it if it happen during the sport. The most common symptom of sports-induced asthma in children is cough; these kids often wheeze as well. There may be no symptom other than shortness of breath; for this  it is important that this lasts much longer than it does for the other kids who are participating just as strenuously  so you know that your child isn't simply getting winded.

1423	Q:20200A:44079	What exactly is bronchial asthma? Bronchial Asthma is an inflammatory Disease of the Bronchi which is caused by allergies and can be triggered by inhaling certain triggers and also by viral and bacterial infections.It usually presents with cough wheezing and shortness of breath.It needs to be treated with controller meds like steroids inhalers and to relieve wheezing bronchdilaters.Acute attack needs steroids by mouth or iv Bronchial asthma  or asthma  is a disease characterized by recurrent episodes of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. It requires a doctor evaluation for diagnosis and treatment. Bronchial asthma (commonly referred to as just asthma) is a medical condition in which the airways have both inflammation (excess mucus and swelling and cells present in airways) and episodic airway constriction or narrowing. Both of these are features of asthma. Albuterol treats the narrowed airways  but other medications such as inhaled steroids are necessary to control the airway inflammation.

1424	Q:347571A:493120	why cant people with asthma take theraflu? Many over-the-counter cold and flu medications contain antihistamines.  We used to believe that asthmatics should avoid antihistamines but this is no longer true.  Use caution when taking any multi-ingredient cough/cold/flu medications; especially if taking other medications.  It is easy to take too much of common ingredients like acetaminophen.If in doubt  ask your doctor or pharmacist. Theraflu has an antihistamine. There is an age old concern that antihistamines could dry and thicken secretions. This has since been not found to be a significant concern. Unfortunately  it takes an act of God to take a warning off a package insert. There is no contraindication. Certainly  it will not help wheezing or shortness of breath.

1431	Q:15963A:19778	What are some forms of prevention for asthma? Avoid triggers--if you know you're allergic to something--like dogs  cats  certain pollens  you are best off avoiding contact with those things.  That is first and foremost.  Then  if you have exercise induced asthma  you should use a Beta agonist inhaler 30 minutes before exercise.  Finally  Inhaled Corticosteroids are used to prevent asthma exacerbations.  Talk to your physician about this. As most asthma is caused by allergies  the best solution is to treat the allergies  as it is impossible to avoid all allergens. I suggest LDA (Low Dose Antigen therapy) or SRT (Sensitivity Removal Technique). They are both able to eliminate allergies to foods  chemicals  and inhalants.

1435	Q:28767A:62556	Are all steroids for asthma ever fattening? Inhaled steroids rarely enter the bloodstream in enough concentration to make a difference. Also  short (<5 day) bursts of oral steroids rarely cause weight gain  either. Inhaled steroids have a local effect and very little is absorbed systemically so these would not tend to cause weight gain. Systemic steroids (ex Prednisone) do tend to result in weight gain. While on systemic steroids it is prudent to watch caloric intake to prevent weight gain as much as possible. Frequent oral steroids can cause weight gain but the inhaled steroids rarely cause any side effects if used correctly.

1437	Q:20203A:54332	How can you prevent asthma? To avoid an asthma exacerbation  one needs to avoid known triggers whenever  possible. But  there are triggers that are difficult to avoid completely  like high pollen counts. Your doctor can help determine what your particular triggers are and help with avoidance when possible. Prevention and long-term control includes avoiding triggers of asthma  such as allergens smoking and infections. Sometimes daily medicines such as inhaled bronchodilators steroids  or oral leukotriene inhibitors singularly or in combination are necessary to prevent asthma.For this type of therapy consult your doctor Asthma is an inflammatory condition caused by genetic & environmental factors. Avoiding allergens (dust mites  pet dander  mold) & irritants (smoke) can decrease the likelihood of developing asthma. Once diagnosed  avoiding these can also help as well as staying on controller medications that keep inflammation from triggering an attack. Regular visits with an asthma specialist can also help.

1439	Q:28835A:74019	If you're an asthmatic  how do you tell the difference between an asthma attack and a panic attack? measuring your peak flows will help.  In an asthma attack your peak flows will be affected but they won't be affected in a panic attack. ...people usually take deep  rapid breaths. In an asthma attack  breathing out is slowed down by the obstruction; it looks like trying to breathe through a straw. At the time of symptoms  a physician examination can reveal the etiology. For example  if you are wheezing and desating during the symptoms  it is likely asthma. If your lungs are clear and your oxygen sat is normal  it is likely anxiety. Pulmonary function testing while the symptoms are present can also be useful in telling the difference. It can certainly result in a feeling of panic if you cannot breathe because of an asthma attack. So it is important to have a doctor examine you during an attack. By the exam or by testing it can be determined which came first. For instance  with asthma the doctor would probably hear wheezing during your attack. The oxygen level in your blood might be low.

That's right; ask anyone with asthma. There are 2 kinds of air pollution - outdoor & indoor. Everyone knows about outdoor pollution. Indoor pollution is cigarette smoke  wood smoke  gases from poorly-functioning gas appliances like a stove  cooking odors & fragrances. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that can have multiple different triggers: allergens  cold air  exercise  smells  and stress for example. In addition there are other diseases that mimic asthma that must be evaluated that could mimic asthma -- churg strauss syndrome  alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency  cystic fibrosis to name a few. See you Doc for full evaluation and treatment plan. Asthma starts with inflammation of the airways. That inflammation can be triggered by many exposures  such as allergies  infections  and weather changes. Irritants like cigarette smoke and dust can also start an asthma attack.

1446	Q:179239A:779021	How to prevent allrgic asthma attacks? To prevent asthma exacerbations  one needs to avoid the allergen triggers as much as possible. This is often difficult to do but by avoiding the allergens  you lessen the chance of having an exacerbation. To indentify your allergic triggers  you may need to see an allergist for allergy testing. The most important thing is to avoid the trigger if known.  Seasonal asthma such as from pollens may require an increase in controller medication before pollen season starts.  Allergy injections are an excellent way to prevent allergic asthma after identifying the causative allergens.

Bronchospasm and airway inflammation occurs resulting in these symptoms. Triggers include airway infections as well as allergic triggers. There is no cure but treatments that control symptoms are effective. See your doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Asthma is caused by a reaction of smooth muscles in your airways which get tight  triggered usually by allergies  but also by chemical irritants like smoke  dust  perfumes  etc. As the airways get tight  it becomes harder to breath  and coughing becomes pronounced and occurs in spasms.

Several cases of deadly brain eating amebiasis have been documented If you're concerned that your child's cough may be due to asthma  please see your child's doctor. Rinsing out the nose with saline helps for coughs from post-nasal drip but won't help asthma. If a bacterial infection is causing the cough  antibiotics may be needed; asthma can be treated with a number of different meds  and inhaled steroids give a much lower dose than oral steroids. cough can be many things beside asthma  including other lung disorders  heart disease  acid reflux  infection  foreign body  or many other issues  so you really need to see a doctor to see what is causing cough and what the options are. Netty pots are most helpful if there is a component of allergic rhinitis with a drippy nose. Then it  is good to keep the nose clean  but unless the nasal allergis trigger a cough it probably won't help an asthmatic cough Several studies have shown minimal long term effects from properly used inhaled steroids in young children.

1469	Q:43296A:28427	How do I know if my child is suffereing from bronchitis or asthma? Asthma is caused by narrowing of the airways (bronchioles). This can occur as the result of airway swelling or airway muscle constriction. Both factors can be involved when when a child wheezes. Viral bronchiolitis is a common cause of wheezing in young kids but may not truely be asthma. Asthma can be triggered by multiple factors: allergy  infections  cold air  exercise  chemical exposures etc. Wheezing that is caused by airway constriction can usually be improved by the use of a   rescue   medications such as albuterol. Sometimes albuterol is used for both bronchiolitis and asthma. Asthma causes wheezing when a person expires (blows out)  wheezing that occurs with inspiration only may suggest upper airway swelling from viral croup or acid reflux problems.

1475	Q:179241A:256151	What are the different types of asthma? Historically  asthma was classified as extrinsic (allergy triggers) or intrinsic (smoke  fumes  cold air).  Also asthma can be classified by severity such as intermittent or persistent (mild  moderate or severe).  Asthma can be occupational or work-related.  Sometimes asthma is classified by predominant symptom such as cough-variant asthma. Asthma is actually one disease with many triggers. For example  for some asthmatics  exercise triggers their asthma to exacerbate and this is labeled exercise-induced asthma. Some patients are triggered by allergens while others are triggered by upper respiratory infections. In all cases  the asthma is the same but the triggers are different.

1479	Q:238622A:374880	How is cough-variant asthma diagnosed  versus   regular   asthma? CVA is what I would consider one of the mildest forms of asthma. In season one may cough intermittently without actually wheezing&be treated for a number of things before the tie in with asthma is realized. Often a simple steroid inhaler will stop the cough after a few days where ABX & cough meds have no effect. Suspicion comes when you have kin with asthma. All asthma is the same for all intents and purposes.  Cough variant simply means that an individual does not seem to wheeze but coughs repeatedly  especially more at night and after exercise.  They treatments are the same  however.   Cough-variant   asthma is diagnosed when the primary symptom of bronchospasm is cough as opposed to wheezing  the usual sign of bronchospasm. The bronchospasm is treated with bronchodilator and steroid inhalers and the cough is controlled with this therapy. The cough in    cough-variant   asthma responds to the usual treatment of asthma.

1481	Q:499806A:743793	Is marijuana healthy for people with asthma? Marijuana smoke contains bronchial irritants. Inhalation with marijuana is more prolonged & deeper than with tobacco.  Higher combustion temperatures are reached because it is smoked to a shorter butt.  This leads to a carboxyhemoglobin concentration that is five times higher than tobacco. 3 times more tar is inhaled. Use of cannabis can lead to airway inflammation  wheezing & increased sputum. No. Smoking marijuana causes irritation to the bronchial passages and will cause your astma to worsen. Please refrain from inhaling anything other than fresh air.

There has been some research that has shown a link between late onset(after puberty) of asthma and certain bacterial infections. The best advise would be to get checked out by an allergist to see if this could possible be the case. Their research showed improvement with 6 weeks of antibiotics in a small group of patients. Azithromycin has been shown not only to kill atypical bacteria which makes asthma worse  but also reduce inflammation. Small studies which examine the effect of azithromycin on improving asthma are conflicting. Therefore  the best use of azithromycin is for severe asthma patients who aren't controlled on standard asthma therapies on a trial basis.

1490	Q:256608A:364232	Which to give first for asthma--bronchodilator or corticosteroids? For an acute attack  short acting bronchodilators should be started first and then steroids afterward.  Bronchodilators temporarily open the airways and are rescue medicines and steroids are maintenance medicines to help prevent chronic and acute inflammation. The 2 medications you mention work very differently. For rescue therapy during an acute exacerbation with cough  wheeze  & trouble breathing  a bronchodilator is the right choice. However  if your asthma symptoms are more persistent  corticosteroids are a great choice to achieve symptomatic control. There are also times when you take the 2 together.

If your asthma has suddenly worsened  you need to be evaluated by your doctor to determine the etiology of the acute change in your condition. Once this is determined  more specific therapy can be rendered. By seeing an allergist  you can confirm that you truly have asthma and determine your triggers.  Then  treatment can include:1. Avoidance measures depending on your allergies2. Medications  including variety or inhalers or other medications3. Allergy injections Asthma is defined as inflammation in the airways; more asthma attacks means more inflammation. To decrease flareups  find out what triggers your asthma (allergies  infections  acid reflux  irritants  etc.) and avoid these as much as possible. You may also need medication that specifically targets inflammation; stay on this as prescribed to keep asthma under control. See your doctor regularly too. The best way to decrease asthma attacks is to reduce breathing tube irritability. This is achieved by taking controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids or oral leukotriene antagonists) daily or more as prescribed by your doctor.

1510	Q:253332A:368136	How is cough variant asthma diagnosed? cough is just a symptom of asthma. If your docotr hears wheezing and is recurrent problem  then you may have asthma for sure. Your docotr needs to do lung trests to establish diagnosis of asthma along with clinicla diagnosis.Some pts. cough at night only & it becomes difficult 2diagnose as the docotr may not be able to listen for wheezing at this time unless u go 2 the ER. All coughs is not asthma Generally  if you have a persistent cough that has not resolved after possible antibiotic treatment for infections  meds for reflux  etc.  but does resolve after talking a short acting bronchodilator like Albuterol  then the action of the bronchodilator may have worked and thus cough variant asthma is possible.

1511	Q:122429A:187531	What are the different symptoms of a child with asthma? The most noticeable symptom of asthma is shortness of breath; it often occurs after activities such as running and giggling  and lasts longer than it does for the other kids they're playing with. Sometimes there is an audible wheeze as they breathe  and others may cough instead of wheeze. A danger sign is when the skin above the collarbone gets pulled in as they inhale; go to the ER. Frequent cough and wheeze are the most typical symptoms in a child with asthma.  Tthese symptoms will usually be worse at night and with viral colds.  Less common symptoms of asthma include chest pain and chest tightness especially with activity.  In children above 5 years of age  lung function testing is very helpful to diagnose asthma.

1512	Q:15951A:22492	Do Inhalers cure asthma? Inhalers only reduce asthma symptoms. To cure asthma  which is possible in some people  you need one of the alternative/complementary modalities  like homeopathy  naturopathy  acupuncture  etc.  My approach to asthma is like that to many other autoimmune diseases: http://bookonhealing.com/conditions/autoimmune-diseases.html They control the symptoms not cure the disease. Asthma is an allergy  an inflammatory process in the lungs. Avoid the allergens and treat or manage the symptoms. They treat symptoms (shortness of breath and chest tightness) but do not cure the disease. An asthma patient has episodes of bronchoconstriction (airways tighten up) plus swelling of the airways & increased mucus. Inhalers like albuterol relax & open up airways; inhalers like Flovent (steroid) prevent or decrease swelling & mucus. Many children outgrow their asthma  so are almost   cured   but may get an episode years later. Homeopathy  supplements  acupuncture  etc... do NOT help asthma. Inhalers do not cure asthma but most patients can be rendered symptom-free with medication therapy. Unfortunately  the is no cure for asthma.  Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that may   flare   depending upon an individual's triggers.  Studies performed with disease   controllers   (oral leukotriene receptor antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids) to see if   cure   or prevention are possible.  Unfortunately  any gains that are obtained while on those medications are lost when stopped.

1513	Q:293744A:740702	Is it possible to have asthma  but not have asthma attacks? The goal of treatment in asthma care is to reduce the frequency or even eliminate asthma attacks by avoiding the cause  using medicines and allergy shots if needed. Theoretically  yes  practically and from a realistic point of view  it is unlikely in my opinion. If you have been diagnosed with asthma that is intermittent  there may be long periods between attacks. If you have been diagnosed with a persistent type and on a   controller   inhaler  you may be under very good control. If you have never  never had an attack  I'm not sure how the diagnosis was made.

1515	Q:43324A:128313	What are the differences between child asthma vs. adult asthma? The disease process is the same for children and adults and that is recurrent episodes of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. It used to be thought that kids had more of an allergic etiology and adults had more exacerbations with infections but there is so much overlap that this is really not a useful distinction. Children with asthma are more likely to have a significant allergic component to their illness. However  allergy can be a factor at any age.  Both childfren and adults respond well to medications  and the agents used are similar.  Typically attacks in children evlove more quickly than those in adults  and children usually respond faster to treatment. Young adults - 30s & 40s - with asthma have had it since childhood or had it during childhood  then had resolution for a decade or so  followed by recurrence. They might recall only having bronchitis often when younger. This is a continuation of a chronic  usually allergy-based illness from childhood. Asthma starting after age 50 is a different disease & usually not allergic in origin.

1519	Q:574986A:862688	I am an asthmatic. I'm needing to utilise my asthma pump more often than I should.. Is the asthma pump causing my lungs to weaken? Asthma medication does not adversely effect the lungs.  The increase of symptoms that has prompted you to use your asthma inhaler more often should be addressed.  This may mean you are being exposed to allergens or irritants leading to more inflammation and more symptoms.  If a person requires albuterol more than twice a week  asthma is not under control and he/she should see a doctor to update. You are in your summer so it most likely is exposures you are around.

Many times when we treat asthmatic patients with anti-allergy medications  often their asthma symptoms improve and sometimes subside. Discuss treatment options with your doctor. More severe cases may need more advanced anti-allergy treatments and your Dr. will refer you to an allergist or pulmonologist if that is in fact the case. Allergies often cause flare ups of asthma.

1522	Q:874149A:1261849	What are the best inhalers for asthma? Every patient with asthma needs a quick relief inhaler and the most common is albuterol or the isomer Lev-albuterol (same effect with less amount of medication.)  For controller medications  corticosteroid inhalers (Qvar  Flovent  Pulmicort  Asmanex) are very similar except Qvar is very small size and better lung deposition.  For more severe asthma  Advair  Symbicort and Dulera--all work well. Albuterol  Asthma  Corticosteroid drug  Corticosteroids  Dulera  Inhaled steroid  Inhaler  Lung  Proventil  Steroid inhaler

1527	Q:12149A:22183	My child has severe diarrhea from a rotavirus  how can I maintain his fluids? In third world countries  pedialyte has saved thousands of children from dying from cholera. Pedialyte is the best electrolyte replacement for the fluid and electrolytes lost with diarrhea. Your child needs to drink a lot of fluids  preferably non citrus juices or electrolyte infused drinks (i.e. Gatorade or Pedialyte).  We don't hold onto much of the water we drink  so the juices and drinks are better for fluid replenishment. a child may do better with frequent small amounts of liquids rather than being faced with a big glass of liquid.  Also  popsicles and jello are sometimes helpful. Frequent small sips of water  weakened Gatorade  or Pedialyte will help avoid dehydration.  Popsicles  ice chips  snow cones and jello are also good alternatives.  Large quantities tend to stimulate nausea and vomiting so keep the quantity small.  Watch for signs of dehydration: decreased urine  crying without tears  dry mouth  lethargy  etc.  See your doctor or the E.R. if any of these occur. Rotavirus infections are common in childhood and they can cause diarrhea that is distressing for the child and the parent.  Diarrhea can lead to dehydration so it is important to make sure your child gets enough fluids.  The best way to ensure this is to give small sips of fluid (Pediatlyte  Gatorade  flat ginger ale).  Ginger ale may be good choice because ginger can help nausea and vomiting. Rehydration fluids designed to replace lost water and blood salts (electrolytes) can be very helpful.  Some authorities prefer rehydration fluids with fiber like ricelyte © which are reported to be more effective at reducing diarrhea.  I would certainly avoid milk products containing lactose until the child is well since many children become lactose intolerant during a bout of rotavirus.

1560	Q:73536A:107816	My son had a lap cholera and they found the major artery to the liver on top of the gall bladder. How common is this? Seek a better explanation or diagram.The hepatic arteries can be variable  and multiple and get in the way  and get damaged - cut-cauterized  stitched in the process   BUT are not usually on top of the gallbladder.Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the operation been trying to describe the finding sometimes seen of a &quot;replaced right hepatic artery&quot; that sometimes makes the artery branch over the cystic duct to the gallbladder &amp; the main artery is carefully preserved to the right portion of the liver. It is estimated that about 20% of patient have some sort of blood vessel anomaly.

1583	Q:88324A:189838	What are the safest home remedies for cholera? Cholera is a bacteria called Vibrio cholera.It likes alkaline pH i.e. acid stops its growth (like cola and limeade). But you need a stomach and intestine that handle them. Unfortunately  these patients vomit a lot. The main treatment is antibiotics. Washing vegetables in acidic solutions like permenganate is used in areas of epidemics. Hand washing is a must to stop transfer of bacteria to mouth. Most healthy people don't get into trouble from cholera - in fact most healthy people  due to their healthy stomach acidity  don't even get cholera. If you are unlucky enough to get it  the principle symptom is profuse  water  diarrhea  so REHYDRATION is key. Using a   rehydration solution   (combination of (safe) water  sugar  salt  and pinch of baking soda) can be life saving!

1584	Q:138939A:298385	When was the chicken cholera vaccine given? The chicken cholera vaccine  first developed by Louis Pasteur in 1870 using chicken eggs  has been given off & on in various locals. It was given to military as late as 1978 ( I got one)   but is not presently available in the US. The side effects of high fever limited effectiveness & short duration of benefit  made the newer oral vaccines the preferred product in the limited areas of need. Fowl (or chicken) cholera vaccine was developed by Pasteur in the late 1800s. The disease is caused by Pasteurella and is not related to human cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae.

1599	Q:116101A:204874	What vaccines wear off and need boosters? Currently  for the general population  tetanus and diphtheria immunity wear off as one gets older. This is the reason why booster shots are recommended every 10 years provided one does not encounter deep dirty contaminated wounds in which case a booster shot maybe administered if the last vaccine was given more than the last 5 years. Any vaccine I know of for a bacterial agent is likely to have a waning effect after several years. Tetanus toxoid is one example  but whooping cough (pertussis)  pneumococcus (meningitis pneumonia)  meningococcus  diphtheria  cholera  all have their limitations.A few viral vaccines are boosted in infants whose immune system may not recognize & respond after one dose.

1611	Q:380583A:920915	My sister is in the hospital with kidney failure. Does she need an organ transplant right away? If she can't get a kidney transplant  will she be able to survive with just dialysis until she can get a donor? The short answer is almost certainly   no    although every patient is different  and critical care patients by definition have complex medical stories.Acute kidney injury (or AKI  also known as   acute renal failure  ) is very common in hospitalized patients  and particularly patients in intensive care (although you do not say your sister is actually in intensive care)  There are degrees of kidney failure ranging from mild and quickly reversible  to permanent and complete.  The kidneys are very sensitive to what is going on around them -- they're sort of the   canary in a coal mine   of our organ systems.  So they tend to protest severe illness early by not making enough urine and allowing toxic byproducts to build up in the bloodstream.Fortunately  usually hospital acquired acute kidney failure goes away with minimal intervention.  When it doesn't  the function of the kidneys can often (depending on the other medical circumstances) be replaced with a machine which removes the things the kidneys usually remove from the blood(dialysis).  Dialysis isn't a perfect replacement for functioning kidneys by any means  but it's good enough for the short term  and many people live for decades on dialysis.  Not every patient can benefit from dialysis -- the choice of whether to initiate dialysis is made on an individual basis.Kidney transplant is usually only made available to patients who have complete and permanent kidney failure  are dialysis dependent  and are doing very well otherwise.I hope you have found this helpful  and that your sister feels better soon. Kidney failure is often reversible. If not  renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) is required.  Dialysis allows the patient to survive without a kidney and can be done immediately. Transplantation leads to better quality of life and long-term survival  but it requires a donor  either brain-dead or living. So often dialysis is required first before transplantation. Kidney transplantation is not done urgently because of the availability of dialysis to achieve stability. This provides the opportunity for cautious education of the recipient +evaluation of all transplant related issues. A possible living donor also needs education and evaluation  and the time to carefully consider options. If no live donor is available  the wait time for a kidney is years.

1613	Q:685630A:1035252	How long can you live after kidney failure if you recieve no treatment? If patient passes no urine at all  the longevity is very short (ie  days). If patient makes urine output  then it depends on 2 factors  the quality and quantity of urine output. The general range is few to several months.

1614	Q:27255A:61804	Could I have kidney failure if the ultrasound was normal? An ultrasound only shows the structure of the kidney.  It can tell whether there is a kidney stone or an something obstructuing urine from leaving the kidney. Kidney failure can still occur even if an ultrasound is perfectly normal. Kidney failure can also be diagnosed with blood and urine tests as well. the kidney is responsible for excreting waste and maintaining salt and water balance among many other functions.these are performed by special cells with enzymes/proteins within the kidney at an ultrastructural levelthe function of the kidney may be reduced even if the ultrasound is normal.ultrasounds are useful to detect size and shape of kidneys and see if the urine flow is blocked Kidney Stones  Urine  Blood  Kidney  Urinalysis  Kidney failure  Previous kidney disease  Sonogram  Repeat ultrasound  ESRD Kidney failure  Urine  Enzyme  Kidney  Protein  Previous kidney disease  Sonogram  Repeat ultrasound  ESRD Kidney Stones  Urine  Blood  Kidney  Urinalysis  Kidney failure  Previous kidney disease  Sonogram  Repeat ultrasound  ESRD Kidney failure  Urine  Enzyme  Kidney  Protein  Previous kidney disease  Sonogram  Repeat ultrasound  ESRD
1615	Q:27253A:1265885	Can chronic kidney failure be prevented? Diabetes mellitus  the most common condition in adults leading to chronic renal failure  is an example that vigorous management can make a difference.  A number of chronic glomerulonephritidis/glomerulopathies  e.g.  lupus nephritis  however  often lead to renal failure in spite of aggressive treatment. It all depends upon the condition that is causing your kidneys to fail.  Some things can be reversed such as simple dehydration with acute renal failure.  Many other things can be slowed down and other conditions cannot be reversed.  So  it really comes down to what the condition is and how early it is in the evolution of the problem.

1617	Q:27256A:59666	How is chronic kidney failure typically diagnosed? Combination of abnormal physical findings such as nonpitting edema  hypertension  and anemia plus abnormal blood chemistries (high BUN & creatinine  low calcium and high phosphorus  and acidosis) allows accurate diagnosis. When visiting your primary care doctor  the doctor can perform simple urine and blood test to rule out chronic kidney problems. The doctor can check your urine for protein or your creatinine on your blood tests to rule out kidney problems.

1619	Q:15804A:23067	Can end stage renal disease be reversed  or is it too late? When End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is diagnosed that means the patient no longer has  kidneys that are effectively filtering toxins from the blood. The use of dialysis or kidney transplant is necessary to maintain life. So ESRD means it is to late to reverse and save any kidney function. Because there are so many different causes of kidney disease  and some are reversible  it's hard to answer this question with a simple yes or no. If it's due to a known disease and the kidneys have declined over time  then the answer is usually yes due to the damage. If it is a brand new issue  and due to some inflammatory conditions  then the answer might be   no   because some meds could help.

1624	Q:8575A:21994	What are the treatments for End-Stage-Renal Disease (ESRD)? dialysis and transplant Most people with ESRD will need to have dialysis  but if your ESRD is not quite to that degree  your doctor will have you follow a special diet  make sure your blood pressure stays low  and have you take medicines that help the kidney to function.  There are 2 types of dialysis  peritoneal and hemodialysis.  Peritoneal is done at home while you sleep  and hemodialysis is done at a center. In most cases  when pt's have reached the End Stage of Renal Disease it means that their kidneys are no longer working at all. And if that is so  then one would usually require 3 times a week dialysis at least to treat buildup of renal waste products in the blood. Also Kidney transplant would be an option as well. 1.Transplantation from either a living related or unrelated donor or deceased donor transplant2 Peritoneal Dialysis - dialysis where toxins are exchanged via a tube placed near the stomach3.Home Hemo dialysis - dialysis performed by the patient and a significant other in the of convenience their home4.

1625	Q:23767A:1206085	If someone has renal failure  how can they be treated for hypernatremia? Patients that are dehydrated could present with both  the numbers of BUN and creatinine and the sodium level elevated. Drs call any increase in BUN and creatinine as renal failure which could be of recent origen or chronic (more insidious onset).  Some patients have chronic renal insufficiency and suddenly get worst due to dehydration. Treatment is intravenous fluids first. Reduce salt intake and balance that against increasing water intake.  The caveat here is where is the patient in the continuum from end-stage renal disease being managed medically to being on dialysis?  Each scenario has different answers to reducing sodium in the blood.  Also important to know is what caused the kidney failure in the first place because treatment has to be tailored to the disease Intravenous fluids  Kidney failure  Dehydration  Creatinine  Sodium  Hypernatremia Blood  Dialysis  ESRD  Hypernatremia  Ingestion  Kidney  Kidney failure  Sodium Intravenous fluids  Kidney failure  Dehydration  Creatinine  Sodium  Hypernatremia Blood  Dialysis  ESRD  Hypernatremia  Ingestion  Kidney  Kidney failure  Sodium
1626	Q:41144A:743962	What is life expectancy for male in 60s with end stage renal disease  diabetes  and CHF? You ask a difficult question as there are multiple factors involved in that person's life expectancy. If one concentrates on dialysis patients  the average life expectancy for a 60-65 year old on dialysis is 4.5 years compared to 17-22 years for similarly aged person not on dialysis. The severity of his CHF would play a role in the patient's life expectancy and would diminish it. Ask his doctor. It depends on a number of factors  including family history and your personal medical history.  Insurance actuarials actually have tables that estimate this  too!

Each of those may shorten life on average a bit and all three of them together a little more  but it is entirely possible to go for many years as is with no medications. Certainly sounds like this individual should have been prescribed at least an antiplatelet agent daily. Chronic kidney disease stage 3 is unfortunately very common. Even without medications if eating a healthy diet and by activity is able to control blood pressure and sugar levels may be able to slghtly delay progression.

1635	Q:516844A:781790	Can patients with kidney failure use glycerin suppositories? Glycerin is not absorbed through the rectum  which is why it draws water out of the body into the stools and helps one have a more productive bowel movement.  It is probably safe to use  but if you use it for more than a few days in a row  you run the risk of dehydrating yourself  which is bad in kidney failure.  I would suggest you see your doctor if the constipation is not improving. I have thought about your question and have dome a little reading.  I can find no reason that a glycerin suppository should harm someone who has kidney failure except for acute kidney failure due to massive fluid loss.  Any added fluid loss under these circumstances will only make matters worse.

1638	Q:362685A:953964	If someone has end stage renal failure. Wouldn't they have severe swelling all over from fluid accumulation? Most likely if developed acutely (suddenly).  If slowly progressed to end-stage (i.e. from chronic kidney disease) then may not as may still be making some urine and/or they may be on a strict renal diet and fluid restriction  and so on.  They might even be on some type of renal replacement therapy (like hemodialysis) that controls the fluid accumulation. It depends if there is still urine output or not. Some people maintain good urine volume even if they are on dialysis and in that case there is an outlet for fluid excess to leave the body.In the absence of urine output only dialysis can remove the extra fluid so a restriction of intake is mandatory. I agree with Dr. Moses and wanted to add that people with advanced kidney disease may have good urine output  but urine   quality   is more important than quantity. Normal kidneys  can filter much more blood per minute than sick ones  even though the end product (urine) may have the same volume as someone with sick kidneys that have filtered much less blood.

1655	Q:400710A:1139596	Legs have been swollen for two weeks i have dibeates and hypertension i was recently dignoised with chronic kidney failure. for the past two weeks my legs and ankles have been swollen really bad  after i soak them or get up from laying down they burn but I think you might have two problems here.  Chronic renal failure (kidney disease) is well-known to cause fluid retention  and thus  swelling in the legs and feet (gravity brings the fluid down there).  While there certainly IS a neuropathy associated with kidney disease  it's much more prevalent in diabetes  especially if your diabetes is not well controlled.  What might relate the two symptoms you're having is this: hydrostatic pressure on the small nerves from the swelling may be making any minor neuropathy feel worse than it is.I don't think you're dealing with an   emergency   situation  but you most definitely should call your doctor today and let him or her know what's going on.  I would not advise soaking them  since warmth will tend to dilate your blood vessels and make the swelling worse.I hope this helps. What stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are you in? See a nephrologist and get a 24 hour urine for creatinine clearance and protein. If you have CKD 1 or 2  you will likely need to see a cardiologist to evaluate your heart's ejection fraction  as CKD of this degree is not normally associated with swelling. If you have a high protein in your collection  that could be the cause of your edema.

Jaundice if related to end stage liver disease combinded with kidney failure is a very troubling combination with a very high death rate. That being said  if you are just guessing that a skin color change is jaundice (high biliribun) then you might be mistaken and the situation not a dire. Talk to your doctor. Jaundice refers to the body becoming yellow in appearance because too much pigment from old red blood cells is not handled normally by the liver +/or bile duct. So it means there is too much destruction of blood cells  or a problem with the liver/bile duct. Jaundice may be separate from or connected with the kidney failure.

1703	Q:552738A:902715	What are the possible negative outcomes for emergency iv fluid treatment for a patient with low blood pressure who also has end stage renal disease? Too aggressive IV fluids in a pt with ESRD can cause fluid overload and bring to pulmonary edema  congestive heart failure  etc  which can be letal. That is why one has to use extra caution managing low blood pressure with fluids The  fact that needs to be ascertained is what the low BP was caused by. Was the patient bleeding or have a heart attack? When was the patient's last hemodialysis?  IV fluids may be appropriate in the short term and the  object of therapy is to find the cause of the low BP and treat it.

1714	Q:106837A:193053	Can kidney failure be detected in a urinalysis? urinalysis looks for protein+blood  sugar  specific gravity  pH. these things may predict kidney damage or kidney disease  but are not sensitive to detect kidney failure.  this is nearly always determined with a blood test of your urea and/or creatinine. A very sensitive marker of acute renal failure is the presence of muddy brown casts. This finding  which is only detectable by microscopic examination  is an excellent predictor of acute tubular necrosis.

1719	Q:15838A:421975	Will drinking more water help reverse effects of kidney failure? If you have a chronic condition that has caused kidney failure then it's important to avoid becoming   dehydrated   because that can temporarily worsen it  but in the long run the answer is   no  ; simply drinking a lot of water won't reverse damage that has occurred. Controlling diabetes (the most common cause)  high blood pressure  or treating other issues that caused the failure are important. Unless your kidney failure is caused by dehydration  drinking fluids will not help a kidney failure. Actually you need to ration liquid intake to avoid fluid overload and edema. If you kitchen sink drain is stopped up  you usually avoid putting much water in it!

1720	Q:27360A:887336	If a person is in end stage renal disease and needs a kidney  would liver damage exclude them from getting a transplant? In order to qualify for a kidney transpalnt  you must be in great physical and mental shape.  Any impairment in other organs will preclude you from getting a kidney transplant.  However depending on the severity of your liver disease  you may qualify for a liver-kidney transplantation. The liver can tolerate a significant degree of damage before it becomes apparent that there is a problem. The extent of damage is assessed in multiple ways ranging from understanding symptoms linked to liver disease (if there are any)  blood tests  imaging tests  and very often a biopsy to look at the liver cells. Severe damage will likely require a liver txp too. Mild to moderate damage may not.

What you usually experience is a loss of energy and appretite.  For you  this will be complicated by having three major organ systems failing at the same time. Medical management can be tricky with this combination so you really should pay strict attention to what your doctors tell you and follow their recommendations completely. Kidney failure only occurs in the very last stages of very severe liver failure  and most people will have ascites (fluid accumulating in the abdominal cavity) and edema (swollen legs and elsewhere) before that occurs. Improvement of the liver disease  which should happen if you COMPLETELY stop drinking  should help considerably. There is no pain generally  lab tests are needed to follow it.

Cramping occurs but using a little Ativan before and just after can help. Ask your doctor. DO NOT GO ALONE! Get a ride to and from your appointment. Although NSAIDS such as Ibuprofen  Advil  Alleve are to be avoided in kidney disease however short term use for few days every month should not pose any problem.  Try with Ibuprofen 200 which is the lowest possible dosing.

Patients with a staph infection can have an endocarditis  which affects the heart valves. Once it is on a valve  septic emboli can be sent to other places  the brain  retina  bone or kidney.

It all depends on the condition  the stage of renal insufficiency  and other medical conditions that coexist.  If a person is at what is termed end-stage renal failure  then dialysis is the best option - either peritoneal or hemo depending on a whole bunch of factors. dialysis is in-center i.e. hemodialysis (blood dialysis)dialysis at home usually peritoneal via abdominal cathetertransplant (living-related  cadaveric  or living-unrelated)or a combination of all the above in sequence Dialysis  ESRD  Hemodialysis  Kidney  Kidney failure  Peritoneal dialysis  Transplant  Transplantation  Previous kidney disease Dialysis  ESRD  Kidney  Kidney failure  Previous kidney disease Kidney failure  Dialysis  Abdomen  Blood  Catheter  Kidney  Transplant  Previous kidney disease  ESRD Dialysis  ESRD  Hemodialysis  Kidney  Kidney failure  Peritoneal dialysis  Transplant  Transplantation  Previous kidney disease Dialysis  ESRD  Kidney  Kidney failure  Previous kidney disease Kidney failure  Dialysis  Abdomen  Blood  Catheter  Kidney  Transplant  Previous kidney disease  ESRD Dialysis  ESRD  Hemodialysis  Kidney  Kidney failure  Peritoneal dialysis  Transplant  Transplantation  Previous kidney disease Dialysis  ESRD  Kidney  Kidney failure  Previous kidney disease Kidney failure  Dialysis  Abdomen  Blood  Catheter  Kidney  Transplant  Previous kidney disease  ESRD

For a 92 year old person your father's kidney and cardiac function are not that all severe. He is not in danger of needing imminent dialysis and his cardiac function  while not normal  is adequate enough to keep him out of the hospital for congrstive heart failure.  His life expectancy is less than 5 years. The important question is  why is he in hospice care? Ask his doctor for more information. It sounds like your father is dealing with a lot of serious illnesses  and as people get older  everything can get more complicated. To qualify for hospice  typically death is expected within 6 months  and most families find hospice a very rewarding and dignified way to care for family members at the end of life.

1740	Q:74837A:119155	My mom's appendix ruptured and her body became infected. Since then she had congestive heart failure chronic kidney failure  can it all be connected? A ruptured appendix can cause bacteria to invade the blood  called septicemia. The bacterial toxins in the blood can lead to inflammation that temporarily damages blood vessels. This can lead to shock and a drop in blood pressure  which may cause damage to the heart  lungs  brain  kidneys  and liver.  These effects are usually NOT permanent unless one has pre-existing chronic medical problems. When an appendix ruptures  there is risk of sepsis.  Sepsis can stress the heart and kidneys resulting in heart failure and kidney failure respectively.

1765	Q:82766A:131942	Will kidney failure kill me? Chronic kidney disease is usually managed by kidney doctor  a nephrologist.  Short of end-stage kidney disease (ESRD)  it is managed symptomatically.  ESRD is managed with dialysis or reversed with kidney transplant.  If a person with ESRD is not treated  they will likely die of uremia as the poisons that are normally cleared by the kidney build up to lethal levels in the blood. If untreated  kidney failure will lead to death. Even when treated  we cannot completely replace the good work that kidneys do  ultimately organs will fail  and death will occur. If kidney failure is mild/stable with an established & eliminated cause (eg from NSAIDS)  you may not have problems from it. If severe  then   renal replacement therapy    w hemodialysis (HD) or kidney transplant is lifesaving.

Also since patients on dialysis tend to be dehydrated  the skin can get dried out as well and cause itching.  Lubrication can help with itching  but get lotions/creams that don't dry the skin out more or it will get worse. Your MD might have some suggestions as well in regards to lotions or tablets to help with it. Most propeller have itching whether they are on hemo or peritoneal dialysis.

1783	Q:77297A:128487	What is the average life expectancy for someone in end-stage renal failure on dialysis? The average life expectancy is 5-7 years on average. Put young patients tend to leave longer than very old patients and healthier more compliant patients tend to do better than those than skip dialysis very often. So don't let the average numbers define overall prognosis. Also once a patient is ESRD they can be listed for transplant which has a higher life expectancy than dialysis patients. it is 3-5 years if dyalisis is being done. mortality rate for people on dialysis is 22%/year. that gives an average of 5 years Very variable. Current medical literature quotes 22% annual mortality rate which suggests 5 year survival rate. However  younger and otherwise healthy subjects can live 10 -20 years on dialysis.

1787	Q:8571A:233767	Is dialysis a cure for kidney failure? Dialysis is by no means a cure for kidney failure. Dialysis is to filter out 'toxic wastes' accumulated in blood and to sustain life.  There is no real cure for kidney failure yet. The best possible would be a successful transplant even if not a permanent solution. It is a form or kidney replacement therapy.  It is not a cure.  Once a person starts on dialysis  the chances that their kidneys will ever start to work again ar pretty slim (there are some exceptions  however).  The added caveat here  is that while dialysis can prolong life  it can never completely replace a good functioning kidney and it is a major life change.

Also  associated illnesses  and extent of their control  like hypertension etc are risks for worse prognosis. But diabetic kidney disease is currently not curable and theoretically all cases will go to dialysis if live enough. Older persons with early disease have less risk of dialysis in their life time.control diabetes to put off dialysis. About 40% of Type 1 diabetes patients with kidney disease will develop kidney failure within 20 years without strict blood pressure and glucose control.

Diabetes mellitus of either type is a serious disease that if not properly controlled  damages the blood vessels of the body.  It commonly affects the eyes (and can blind a person)  heart  kidneys  brain  and legs/feet.  If a patient has kidney failure due to DM2  then it's likely that the diabetes has also affected the eyes.  The diabetes must be controlled to stop the damage- c Endocrinologist Diabetes can certainly affect the eye causing diabetic retinopathy.  If someone has renal failure due to diabetes it is very likely they also have retinopathy.  Kidney failure may affect blood pressure  which may have an affect on the eyes.

1810	Q:148693A:219035	What are the symptoms of kidney failure if high blood pressure? Both high blood pressure and kidney failure are dangerous because they are not easily detectable. Kidney failure usually will not be evident until the more advanced stages at which point patient may experience poor appetite nausea and weight loss. Swelling of the legs and blood in urine can also be seen in some forms. Appetite  Nausea  Kidney failure  Blood in urine  Losing weight  High blood pressure  Leg  Blood pressure  Urine  Blood
1811	Q:508396A:762173	Swelling in Ankles that comes and goes. Started this week. Kidney failure? While kidney failure certainly can have ankle swelling as one of its symptoms  there are many other conditions that can lead to ankle swelling. These conditions can range from things as simple as wearing socks that are too tight  to very serious conditions such as heart disease. Excessive salt intake  standing on your feet for hours are other causes. It's time for some real data - see your doctor. You need to see a doctor for an exam to determine the cause . While kidney failure and heart failure can cause this  many other less horrible explanations exist especially in an othwise healthy 18 yo (my assumption of your past medical history). Cut down on amount of salt you eat and go see your medical doctor to be on the safe side. Unless you have risk factors for kidney disease  I would say it is unlikely. Risk factors include family history  high blood pressure  diabetes and African American race to name a few. The best thing to do is see your local family physician and have a complete exam.

And if Pericardium (memebrane around heart) is inflammed it can have diffuse ST ( one segment of EKG ) elevation. If you are talking about a pericardial effusion  fluid in the pericardium which surrounds the heart  a better test to diagnose this is an echocardiogram. This will give an estimate of the fluid found there.An EKG can show low voltage  but that is not diagnostic of a pericardial effusion.A chest X-ray will show an enlarged heart.

1817	Q:920617A:1326758	What exactly does borderline kidney failure mean? & what can be done to keep them to get worse? Is ther e something im doing causing them to fail? Kidney disease often results from hypertension  diabetes  hi cholesterol  but can be related to less common illnesses like lupus as well. The best approach to lessening your chance of decline is to manage your BP and sugars. Borderline probably means stage 1 or 2 disease. the stage is determined by age  blood tests and body weight. Seeing a nephrologist is a good idea as well to. Two things that can lead to kidney failure (ESRD) are poorly controlled hypertension and  diabetes. If you have those problems make sure you have your BP well controlled and if you are diabetic  make sure you are under the care of an endocrinologist. See a nephrologist (N) and have a 24 hour urine collection to get your actual kidney function determined.

1819	Q:515803A:777615	Al in hospital cant go home cuz his sodium is too low.  Could his existing cronic kidney failure &stage 3 bone  cancer contribute to that condition? Cancer causes something callEd SIADH making the body retain more water than salt leading to lack of equilibrium between the two. The test will show low salt  note it is actually more water and not low salt content of the body. That is why he will be told to cut on fluid intake. CKD makes it a bit more likely for low sodium concentration to be severe. the most common diagnosis in advanced cancer patients is Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone. This often results in low sodium. Kidney failure can also contribute to low sodium levels.

If you are regimented  and have good catheter function  you should be near baseline. Unfortunately people with kidney failure almost universally complain of decreased sex drive and problems with erections.  This is not as much due to dialysis  but the renal failure itself.

1821	Q:154268A:246621	Are chronic hypertension patients regularly tested for kidney failure? Most physicians following the same guidelines when it comes to health screening. A patient with high blood pressure would be checked for diabetes  elevated cholesterol  and kidney dysfunction from time to time. The testing is  a simple blood and urine test. in well controlled hypertension patients we usually watch kidney function at least once a year if not more frequently. If there is evidence of early kidney damage then that frequency might be more often. A blood test or a urine test will give us a good idea how the kidneys are functioning.

1826	Q:95588A:158876	If someone has septic shock and kidney failure what can we do? Septic shock should be treated in an intensive care setting becuse it is a serious problem and leads to multiple organ failure including the kidneys. The patient often reuqires respiratory and heart support with machines and medications. The renal failure often recovers with ICU care  but sometimes it may not in which case renal replacement therapy (dialysis or hemofiltration) These are worrisome problems that may not be compatible with survival. However  in an ICU setting  the team will consider each problem individually to develop the wisest strategy. Among them will be treating the septic shock source  using antibiotics  probably using artificial respiration  blood pressure support  dialysis. If overall picture is too ominous  they may advise care withdrawal. Septic shock leading to kidney failure is one of the most devastating medical conditions  and all such patients should be in an intensive care unit.  The patient needs to be under the care of a medical team consisting of an intensivist  pulmonary  infectious disease and nephrology doctors.  The mortality from this condition is over 80-90% and almost always some form of dialysis is required.

The best way to assess kidney function is a simple blood test that determines the level of various elements in the blood. When the kidneys begin to fail levels of a material called creatinine will go up as well as the blood urea nitrogen. Confuse.  He should be tested with a routine chemistry panel which would identify this  after seeing his primary care doctor. Please se this person before it becomes an emergency.

1833	Q:335437A:469574	If a person is in end stage renal disease and needs a kidney  would age exclude her from transplant? Some centers do have upper limits on the age of people they transplant.  Other centers base the decision off of the persons overall health.  Our center had an 80 yo person who was transplanted and lived off of dialysis for 9 years. It depends on several factors.  Age is definitely an issue  but they often use extended criteria donor kidneys for older patients (the kidney may be older).  I have seen transplant patients in their 80s get kidneys.  The biggest issue is that the patient has to be stable enough (heart  lungs  body) to tolerate a transplant.

1848	Q:186226A:275021	If someone has septic shock and then gets  kidney failure with dialysis is there any chance they will recover? They likely have ATN (acute tubular necrosis) from sepsis and septic shock which does recover depending on if there was any kidney damage prior to the ATN  age of the patient  and how long the patient is/was in septic shock.

1854	Q:8570A:233763	What is dialysis and how is it used to treat kidney failure? Dialysis replaces kidney function by removing waste products and impurities from the body and helps to maintain a normal chemical balance. Hemodialysis means that your blood is circulated thru a hemodialysis machine where the impurities and products of protein metabolism are filtered out. Peritoneal dialysis involves a small tube entering the abdomen and having fluid irrigate to restore balance The process of dialysis is to take blood out of a patient who has kidney failure and send that blood through a dialysis machine.  Inside the machine  blood is filtered  somewhat like a normal kidney but much less effiiciently taking out waster and water that has accumulated in the blood.  The processed blood is then returned to the patient. Typically  dialysis takes place for 4 hrs 3 days/wk.

1862	Q:27267A:83976	How much kidney failure do you have had in order to have go on dialysis? The decision to initiate dialysis usually is based on several factors. First laboratory testing can be performed to estimate the glomerular filtration rate which typically is 15 or less. In addition clinical signs are taken into account such as the presence of swelling  poor appetite  weight loss  and decreased level of functioning. The need for dialysis is not easily quantified by how much kidney failure you have  other than none. That is because of the multiple kinds of damage a kidney can have  and also on other illnesses you may have  like heart disease  the kind of diet you eat  and even your goal for dialysis (buying time or getting back to work).

Dietary management is a key to staying healthy for someone with kidney failure. Your dialysis team will provide a specific set of foods to avoid or limit. They will also frequently measure your values of calcium and phosphorous  for example. Some of the foods to typically avoid include bananas  tomatoes and potatoes. Ask your team about more specific advice. Phosphorous is present In milk  cheese  nuts  meats and other foods.  Limiting the amount of phosphorous eaten and taking binders  pills that stick to phosphorous in the gut preventing absorption  is of vital importance for a dialysis patient.

1897	Q:27269A:60231	What are the treatments for end-stage renal disease (esrd)? End-stage renal disease is defined as insufficient kidney function to support life. The time frame within which life will end varies depending on how the patient restricts intake of fluids + products (like potassium) that are managed by the kidneys. If no treatment is provided (or accepted by the patient)  death will eventually occur. The only 2 treatment options are dialysis or transplantation. dialysis either hemodialysis in the dialysis center or at home or peritoneal dialysis at home.kidney transplant from a deceased or live donor Dialysis  ESRD  Potassium  Transplantation  Ingestion  Kidney  Transplant  Kidney failure Kidney transplant  Dialysis  ESRD  Peritoneal dialysis  Kidney  Transplant  Kidney failure Dialysis  ESRD  Potassium  Transplantation  Ingestion  Kidney  Transplant  Kidney failure Kidney transplant  Dialysis  ESRD  Peritoneal dialysis  Kidney  Transplant  Kidney failure

1900	Q:155405A:249186	What is the treatment for acute kidney failure? Causes are a wide array of possibilities. Based on the diagnosis the doctor will treat the cause. Also  the kidneys will sometimes need support with dialysis until the case recovers. Otherwise  the doctor will fill in for the kidneys in their relative absence from the job e.g. adjusts electrolytes  hemoglobin  acidosis  blood pressure  edema until the kidneys return to duty and take over.

Persons with chronic renal failure are often under-producers of erythropoietin  so are given injections every 1-4 weeks to boost level and increase red blood count to prevent issues with anemia. Can be life-long. Your mother has anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it is appropriate that she is receiving Epogen. As kidneys go into later stages of CKD  they cannot make a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells and are anemic as a result.

1903	Q:213952A:323593	What can cause sudden kidney failure? renal failure has three main causes. A sudden  serious drop in blood flow to the kidneys. Heavy blood loss  an injury  or a bad infection called sepsis can reduce blood flow to the kidneys. Not enough fluid in the body (dehydration) can also harm the kidneys. Damage from some medicines  poisons  or infections. A sudden blockage that stops urine from flowing out of the kidneys (stones and tumors).

1904	Q:110872A:186533	If soneone has kidney failure how long will they live on average  with no transplant? This depends on the age of the person in renal failure.  People that are younger and are otherwise healthy could live for many years before a transplant.  As people get older their life expectancy on dialysis decreases.   Pushed for a definate answer I would say 20 years for someone under 15  10 -15 for people in their 20-30's  5-10 years  for people in their 40-50's and 2-5 for most  over 60 It depends on how much function a damaged kidney has left.  If the kidney has limited function left  then a person will not last long as they will develop abnormal electrolyte problems as well fluid build leading to a quicker demise.  If there is more function available  thena person will live longer. Life expectancy with end stage renal disease (kidney failure) would be impacted by other systemic diseases (diabetes  heart disease  cancer   etc.) and age at the time of diagnosis.  There have been people leaving 20 years or more on dialysis.

1908	Q:74047A:111026	I read somewhere that Chronic Renal Failure can present with polyuria. Then how is it that Acute renal failure is the opposite? the kidney loses concentrating ability also  so that at a certain stage of renal failure polyluria can be the main complaint. Usually at night. (nocturia)  when too much urine production interupts sleep. chronic renal failure in late stages may present with polyurea. Acute renal failure especially acute tubular necrosis may present with low urine output but need not be the case always. Acute renal failure during recovery phase may also be polyuric. Chronic renal disease causes a defect in the kidney's ability to conserve water (urine) so you urinate more.  Acute renal failure is usually more rapid severe damage that interferes with the kidney's ability to form water.  If you can't make urine  you cannot survive more than a few days  so there is no chance to develop chronic renal failure Some types of acute renal insufficiency resolve with a large amount of urine production as the kidney regains some normal function.Some types of chronic renal insufficiency involve loss of protein or electrolytes and large amounts of urine production can result.Both acute and chronic renal insufficency have types where little or no urine is made.

Back pain can be caused by many structures in the back or organs in the abdomen.  Common causes of severe back pain is spinal compression fractures  disk disease and facet arthritis  other serious causes should be ruled out by his primary care physician.  MRI scan is the most helpful test for diagnosing the cause of back pain  but still it is often negative or inconclusive.  For most causes of back pain the initial treatment is rest  anti-inflammatories  pain medicine and physical therapy or chiropractic therapy.  Patients who fail these treatments may benefit from spinal injections or surgery.Please see my HEALTH GUIDES on spinal compression fractures  disk disease and facet arthritis for more information. Good luck! There are many conditions that can lead to debilitating back pain.  He could have problems with a disk in his spine. Perhapss nerve roots that are compressed. The pain could be from muscles or ligaments.  He could have arthritis. Maybe the pain is from underlying organs such as problems with his kidney.  The list of what  could be possible causes for severe back pain is very long.

A living donor kidney transplant from a kind relative is probably your best bet: there's no substitute for functioning  kidneys. Even the best dialysis isn't equivalent! But  do you know about peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis? You may be able to get more effective dialysis - and more flexibility for your personal life. Ask your nephrologist or dialysis center about home training. The term itself indicates that you have severe kidney disease. It could only be changed likely by a transplant.  Once the kidneys are at your stage they do not improve. esrd from high blood pressure requiring dialysis will not be reversible. A kidney transplant maybe an option for you.

There are many different types of congenital uropathy  and the complications may vary  but  in general  the answer to your question is YES  the baby would be at risk. Some types of uropathy can be completely fixed by surgery (eg  blockage of a urinary tube)  others are the result of a malformed or maldeveloped kidney  which can't be fixed directly without transplantation. You need expert advice. Congenital obstructive lesions in urinary tract  e.g.  ureteropelvic junction obstruction or ureterocele   have a lower potential to damage the kidneys when  relieved early in life.

1938	Q:686107A:1035886	What can be done to help kidney failure? If the kidneys have actually failed  you will need   renal replacement therapy:   hemodialysis (the kidney machine)  peritoneal dialysis  or a kidney transplant. But if they are still working  ask your doctor about how you can maximize their function for as long as possible. Caring for diabetes and high blood pressure will help.

1946	Q:37089A:61850	Why does kidney failure cause you to get fluid in your lungs? When the kidneys fail  the body loses the ability to excrete urine.  Therefore a person in kidney failure who drinks fluid will not be able to excrete this fluid.  Then this fluid will back up into the lungs. Kidneys are very important for fluid balance in the body.  They filter our toxins and regulate your volume status (how much fluid you have in your body).

1949	Q:78228A:126180	What sort of disorder is end-stage renal disease (E.R.S.D.)? it means your GFR (renal function) is less than 15 (normal is >90.  60-90 is borderline.  <60 is renal insufficieny) . ESRD is basically to the point you will need dialysis. End Stage Renal Disease is the worst severe disease of the function of the kidney and when pts need either a transplant or dialysis to survive. It is measured as Creatinine Clearence of less than 15  usually the BUN ( uremic nitrogen) is around 100 and creatinine may be around 4.0 pt may have symptoms like nausea and vomiting  generalized itching  tremors or specific tremor called asterixis. ERSD/kidney failure means most of kidney function has been lost + that subject will die unless they undergo dialysis or receive a kidney transplant. Means that kidney/s are unable to remove the nitrogenous waste products produced by your body produced by metabolising ingested protein + spent muscle.

Kidney stones are somewhat unpredictable  but size and location are important factors. Stones may block your kidneys and cause infection and loss of kidney function and this process is not always painful. The decision to observe stones should be done in consultation with a urologist It depends on where the stone is.  If it ends up blocking the tube that leads out of the kidney or from the bladder  it can cause further pain and can lead to kidney disease (from obstruction).

It depends s lot on what caused it in the first place. if he does not take meds to harm his kidneys  controls his blood pressure  and lives a healthy lifestyle and the underlying problem is controlled stage iii kidney disease itself should not be too life limiting. Tell your dad we consider him relatively young.  He might fear the idea of a dialysis machine.  He needs an evaluation by a kidney specialist (nephrologist); dialysis  if it's ever needed  need not require a machine.  A safer method  performed at home by the patient  has proven effective  freeing the patient from the need to go to a center.  Have him see the doctor. ESRD  Kidney  Kidney failure

Most urologists will use lithotripsy to break up the stone  or do a cystoscopy (look up from the urethra into the bladder and ureter) and use some mechanical way of extracting the stone). By   60% blockage on my right kidney   I'm assuming you mean a kidney stone blocking the urine outflow. Because repairing a blocked blood vessel to your kidney is a somewhat more complicated surgery  and my previous advice does not apply to a vascular repair of your kidney's artery. Most important is to understand that with Stage 4 renal failure and coronary artery disease you are fairly likely to develop kidney failure in the future. The question is how long. Your job is to address factors in your control such as weight  blood sugar  blood pressure  medications  smoking. The procedure sounds like it is not   open    and will use balloons + lithotripsy.

I am 66 years old. 66 years old with CKD & Vascular Calcification. Yes  you need to be concerned. You probably have Hyperlipidemia ( High Cholesterol ) ? Diabetes Mellitus II  with CKD  high risk for Coronary Artery Disease  as well. You probably are a Vasculopath. Get help & get checked soon. Sounds trouble to me. By age 66 it would be uncommon not to have some amount of calcium deposition in the blood vessels. Only problematic if it begins to block the blood flow in those vessels. X Rays nearly always demonstrate some calcification by this age. Stage 2 out of 5 stages means not quite normal function and should be a warning sign to protect your kidneys with weight  BP  glucose and med selection control. If you have calcification (C) of your arteries  you should see a physician to be tested for more advanced chronic kidney disease as well as being evaluated for diabetes and high cholesterol levels.

2005	Q:437710A:591157	Can dehydration cause kidney failure? The level of dehydration necessary to cause kidney failure relates to the diminished blood flow through the kidney.If it drops the blood pressure low enough that the blood flow cannot nourish the kidney cells  they will become injured & eventually fail.

2007	Q:98805A:188751	How severe must kidney failure be before you need a transplant? A kidney transplant is needed when the kidneys do not function sufficiently to sustain life.  In practice once someone starts dialysis they become eligible--but a number of criteria need to be met.  In addition  rules for listing patients in the United States are that just before dialysis is needed  when the renal function is very low (a GFR under 20cc/min)  a patient could be transplanted. A transplant should only be performed when kidney failure is concluded to be permanent. Kidney function is measured from the creatinine levels in the blood and urine. If no urine is made  there is no function. The nephrologist (kidney doctor) judges when function must be supplemented with dialysis or a transplant  based on the measures  and patient's symptoms (fluid retention  high potassium  etc) Either already on dialysis or vey close to it ie the calculated GFR (a measure of kidney function) is less than 20.

2008	Q:15859A:422260	Who is at risk for a kidney failure and transplant? Kidney(renal) failure is a very widespread entity with many categories.  Most severe cases where the blood supply to the kidney is compromised [either from infection  obstruction  or collagen vascular disease]; and treatments fail to restore the blood supply can lead to the   death   of the kidney and may lead to transplantation; again as an end game scenario. kidney disease in family or chronic disease like diabetes and hypertension  hypercholesterolemia  and obesity for the person in question are risk factors.

2017	Q:11781A:83754	Can Gonorrhea contribute to kidney failure in men? Gonorrhea can lead to narrowing (called stricture) of the male urethra. If the stricture is so narrow as to cause complete urinary tract obstruction then the entire urine system would fail due to the pressure  but is unlikely to happen.  Common complications of gonorrhea in men and women are joint infection  heart failure and meningitis.  Heart failure and meningitis can lead to kidney failure. Top 4 complications from gonorrhea [gc]: sterility  infectious arthritis  diseased heart valves  meningitis.

2022	Q:27254A:1214244	Can creatine cause kidney failure or not? Ingesting creatinine causes water to be pulled into cells and when taken without a whole bunch of water for rehydration could easily cause acute renal failure secondary to loss of circulating blood volume to the kidneys.  The key here to creatine use is also taking in large valumes of water to avoid side effects.  If you have abnormal kidney function already  I would not recommend taking creatine. By itself  creatine is usually not toxic  and is actually a naturally occurring substance in the human body. However  it is known to cause inflammation in the kidney sometimes (interstitial nephritis) and is best avoided by people who have preexisting kidney damage. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/creatine/NS_patient-creatine/DSECTION=safety Acute kidney failure  Acute renal Failure  Blood  Creatine  Creatinine  ESRD  Kidney  Kidney failure  Rehydration  Previous kidney disease Body  Creatine  ESRD  Inflammation  Interstitial nephritis  Kidney  Kidney damage  Kidney failure  Nephritis  Safety Acute kidney failure  Acute renal Failure  Blood  Creatine  Creatinine  ESRD  Kidney  Kidney failure  Rehydration  Previous kidney disease Body  Creatine  ESRD  Inflammation  Interstitial nephritis  Kidney  Kidney damage  Kidney failure  Nephritis  Safety

2024	Q:20623A:69786	If someone has Cardiomyopathy as a result of Amyloidosis and is now Palliative  can this stage bring Renal Failure? Amyloid proteins that deposit in the heart also can form in kidneys. In advanced heart disease  there's usually amyloid in the kidneys as well and renal function can deteriorate.Advanced cardiac Amyloid also leads to congestive heart failure  with inefficient ejection of blood from heart  leading to reduced blood flow to kidneys. Like other forms of heart failure  this can cause renal failure. Amyloid can cause a cardiomyopathy. If the heart is severely compromised in the later stages of the illness  there will be an inability of the heart to pump the blood forward through the arteries. This may cause the blood flow to the kidneys to also be compromised and result in a picture that looks like renal failure.

Generally weekly transfusions are a sign that normal blood production has shut down.  Blood production problems are usually a late manifestation of malignancies like myeloma.  I have seen patients  for example with AML or MDS  persist for many months even on weekly transfusions  so it's hard to say what a   timeline   for your brother might be.  Good luck with a tough situation. Agree with prior answer that difficult to say. If not already involved ask for a palliative medicine specialist to work with your hematology-oncology team.

2070	Q:8581A:70669	Is Anemia linked to kidney failure? The kidney makes a hormone called erythropoietin which tells the bone marrow to make more blood.  If the kidneys are failing  they do not make this hormone anymore which can lead to anemia. Hope this helps. Kidney failure is often associated with anemia.

2071	Q:613520A:916270	Can acute kidney failure recover even if the  kidney shrunk and has IgAn? Once kidneys have become small  they are very diseased. If the acute kidney failure does recover (which we would certainly hope happens) it is unlikely that normal kidney function would be attained. If sufficient recovery to stay off of dialysis does happen  it is important to treat those kidneys as gently as possible with excellent BP control and avoidance of injury from meds or contrast dye. If your ultrasound shows shrunken or small kidneys then there could be considerable fibrosis which is not reversible.

I am going to presume that your doctor has measured your serum creatinine as she/he has monitored your diabetes treatment.  If your serum creatinine is higher than it should be for your age  then you have signs of renal insufficiency with diabetes.  Keeping your blood sugar as normal as possible and taking certain medicines can reverse part of the effect on your kidneys. Yes  both blood work and urine studies will show the presence of diabetes (D). Glucose in the urine is a sign that D is present  as well proteinuria (P). While D is not the only disease that will cause P  it is one of them. Blood results that show diabetic kidney disease are high Hb A1c  BUN and creatinine levels.

2086	Q:8541A:84927	What is kidney failure and how is it treated? Kidney failure can be caused by many things but in United States it is primarily diabetes and hypertension. Thus treatment is focused on effective control of the underlying problem. Primary kidney diseases such as glomerulonephritis have to be treated by a nephrologist. Kidney failure means some decrease in the function of both kidneys as a whole. Acute if recent  chronic if old.  We measure creatinine and BUN in blood to have an estimate of the function of the kidney. When. The creatinine is >1.0 bun >20 and the eGFR <90 there is renal failure.

2089	Q:10684A:444529	Are vascular conditions a common complication of kidney failure? Kidney failure  in and of itself  doesn't directly cause any vascular conditions  however  it is a rare stand alone condition. It is usually caused by chronic diseases such as diabetes and/or hypertension  heart failure etc. Those conditions  in turn  can lead to vascular complications  such as stroke  heart attack  gangrene etc. Disease of kidney vessels (narrowing) may also cause kidney failure. A blockage in the artery that supplies blood to a kidney can diminish the kidney until it is irreversibly damaged.  Hypertension and diabetes when out of control can accelerate vascular disease and kidney damage. So yes  pad/ peripheral artery disease can cause or accelerate kidney disease.

Risk of heart disease is high in ESRD patients. Low blood pressure can be due to heart issue. Other possibility is so called dry weight or base weight which is addressed in dialysis. Medication should also be reviewed. Blood pressure after dialysis is related to the volume removed with the treatment. If his blood pressure is high between dialysis treatments  then this finding of high blood pressure is more dangerous to him and may be related to salt and fluid intake between treatments.

2094	Q:687084A:1035437	What type of diet for kidney failure? For kidney failure   not on dialysis  low protein  potassium  and salt are advised. But  on dialysis  the protein should be increased to prevent malnutrition and make up for protein lost to dialysis filters. Low potassium and salt are the same for dialysis patients. The fluids are usually restricted in both groups to less than 1500 ml i.e. 1.5 liters=1.5 quarts= 50 ounces. Count fluids in food too If you are on dialysis or heading for a transplant  you will have a Renal Dietician to help. Most people in renal failure will restrict salt  protein  phosphate  and potassium. Fluids will be limited also.

2102	Q:27262A:103288	What are the signs and symptoms of approaching kidney failure? As the kidneys fail it is common (but not universal) to have difficulty with fluid balance. Many people begin to swell due to the kidneys inability to get rid of adequate fluid  even with the use of diuretics (like furosemid). This leads to ankle/leg swelling (edema)  weight gain  difficulty breathing and elevated blood pressure. All of these will likely improve with dialysis or transplantation.

Kidney failure? I work out. I'm lean and muscular. So my creatinine has usually been 1.4 to 1.5 since med school.  I'm also a pathologist and know when lab values do NOT indicate disease. The practice of giving an   estimated GFR   and sending healthy folks like us to the nephrologist is a product of beancounters far removed from real medicine. Keep taking care of yourself  and don't get fixated on numbers. Why is your BUN/creatinine being checked so often?

2104	Q:590148A:880101	I recently went for blood count and  my creatinine level was 1.34. Are my heading towards kidney failure. Can it be managed ? Creatinine is a breakdown product of muscle cells  and it's normally eliminated by the kidneys. When it's elevated  it may imply that kidneys aren't functioning as well. Since diabetes and high blood pressure are the main causes of kidney failure  make sure you're OK in these areas.

The doctors believe the rsv is what started everything else. Her mother says she began getting sick on Friday RSV in older kids & adults is the cause of about 80% of the common cold symptoms when it moves through a town. I have seen it trigger asthma as late as 8 yrs  but to me it is a simple respiratory virus. Anyone with a minor cold (or RSV) could go on to develop pneumonia & an overaggressive bacterial germ or dehydration could put a kid into kidney failure. The bacteria is the major issue not the RSV I am so sorry that your daughter is so ill and I wish the best for her.  Viruses and infections can come on very rapidly in children  as with your daughter.  If your other children begin having fever  cough  or other symptoms then their pediatrician should see them immediately.  It is however very rare for children to get as sick as your daughter from RSV though it definitely does happen.  With most children it is a minor illness.

2257	Q:766053A:1125450	Having ovarian cyst removed and terrified of not waking up from anesthesia. Why can't they do local instead of general. The local anesthetic cannot get to the deeper tissues  in this case the ovary. If you have an open procedure this operation could be done under regional anesthesia (epidural/spinal). Talk to your surgeon about options. The risks of anesthesia are very small  and a discussion with your anesthesiologist would help with your fears. Good luck. You are probably having laparoscopic surgery which almost always requires general anesthesia for the best operating conditions.  It is extremely unlikely that a generally healthy patient having minor surgery  would die from general anesthesia performed by trained clinicians in a modern facility. It is so unlikely that we are not sure of the exact risk  but think it is under 1 in 250000 anesthetics Impossible. Probably will be done via laparoscopy which requires General Anesthesia. At 29  very unlikely you to have any coexisting diseases  hence possibility of complications is very small but not impossible.

There are no   pieces   left after an ovarian cyst ruptures. Each month a fluid filled follicular cyst is formed  matures an egg and usually  the fluid is reabsorbed by the body. An   ovarian cyst   occurs when the normal follicle doesn't go away  just enlarges. They are large enough to rupture at about 4 cm  large enough for surgery at 6. A   ruptured   cyst just leaks out fluid. There's nothing solid. Most of the time  when an ovarian cyst ruptures the pain is due to small bleeding into the abdominal cavity from where a benign functional cyst had ovulated and released an egg (but in an area that caused more bleeding than usu).  Sometimes surgery is required (for large loss of blood  or intractable pain)  but the body will absorb the blood over time  and often surgery is not needed.

Less frequently  colorectal cancers can be founs that do not arise from polyps. This most often happens in inflammatory bowel disease.

2623	Q:593957A:884741	I have polyps in my uterus. I've heard that they should be removed but my OBGYN says otherwise. Should I get them scraped out or leave them alone? If there are polyps in your uterus (not on your cervix)  generally they are removed because they can cause abnormal bleeding. Cervical polyps are removed if you have bleeding with sex. Talk with your doc. At age 26  these are unlikely to be a health problem.  They can cause irregular or heavy bleeding. However  If you have risk factors for uterine cancer (infrequent periods  obesity) then they may contain hyperplasia (an early pre-cancerous change).  Only removing them can tell you the answer for sure.

2627	Q:654836A:993837	I have a colon polyp that needs to be removed surgically but the doctor's first appointment is not till May.  Is this too long to wait? While your biopsy result may have been benign  we sometimes find cancers when removing the entire polyp.  If your appt isn't till May  your surgery could be 6-8 weeks away. That is simply too long to wait with this   cloud   of a possible cancer hanging over you. Ask your primary care doctor to contact that surgeon to get an earlier appt. If that's not possible  find another surgeon. Good luck! The polyp has taken months to years to develop  and a few more weeks will not be significant. Most likely  but not certainly  is benign. Depends on sIze  shape  initial biopsy results  etc.  Ask the GI doc who did procedure re: urgency of surgery.

If nasal polyps are small  do not cause significant symptoms and do not invade local structures  like the eye socket and area around the brain then they do not have to be removed If you have a nasal polyp on one side - yes it should be removed to make sure it is nothing more serious. Polyps almost always affect both nasal/sinus cavities. If it is seen on only one side - it should be biopsied (or removed). Polyps do not   need to be removed.

2630	Q:484662A:714620	Can I treat nasal polyps without surgery? Some patients are very successful ny using steroid nasal sprays or sinus rinses. There is a higher risk of absorption into the body with placing steroids into the rinses. Another help would be getting an allergy test and avoiding triggers or getting an allergy shot. But if you are still obstructed  surgery is an outstanding way to relieve the obstruction. Sometimes.  I have often had success avoiding surgery by treating polyps with short periods of steroids  then placing patients on a steroid nasal spray to diminish recurrence.  This does not work with everyone  in which case surgery may be needed.  Even then  I tell patients to think of surgery as a   haircut    since polyps have a tendency to recur.     www.MainLineENT.com Body  Hypersensitivity  NaSal  Nasal polyps  Nose  Obstruction  Occlusion  Polyp  Saline nasal spray  Sinus Menses  NaSal  Nasal polyps  Nose  Polyp  Saline nasal spray  Steroid nasal spray  Steroids  Chronic sinusitis  Surgery Body  Hypersensitivity  NaSal  Nasal polyps  Nose  Obstruction  Occlusion  Polyp  Saline nasal spray  Sinus Menses  NaSal  Nasal polyps  Nose  Polyp  Saline nasal spray  Steroid nasal spray  Steroids  Chronic sinusitis  Surgery
2631	Q:325952A:460083	How long would adenomatous colon polyp take to turn into cancer? In general 8 to 10 years. This is known as the Adenoma to Carcinoma Sequence. This is why screening colonoscopy is recommended every 10 years to look for polyps. If you have polyps the current thinking is that it takes over 5 yrs to develop a polyp and have it turn in to cancer. That is why the current reccomendation is to get a colonoscopy every 5 yrs with hx of polyps. Other genetic polyp formers such as familial adenomatous polyposis have a far more rapid cancer formation rate.

2637	Q:288571A:417054	my husband had polyps in his rectum and sigmoid colon. They were taken out by using a snare and were biospied showing to be malignant. He then had another rectal exam and biopsy of the cell walls this showed that the it did not spread into the lymph nodes what is your question. Lymph node status can only be detected possibly with CT or PET scan and surgical specimen removal  that is  after colon &/or rectal resection. Colon and rectal carcinoma is one of the most common. Depending on age  stage  and grade of the tumor  a multimodality approach will be used to manage him.  Without a pathology report of the grade  extent of invasion  wall involvement  and true lymph node spread  you will need to have a more complete examination. Radiation  surgery  and oncology  with pathology all need to be involved. your husband will need to have a complete work-up- i.e. at a very minimal to have a CT scan  plus minus a PET scan  and an endoscopic ultrasound for staging purposes. Rectal cancer requires multi disciplinary approaches. he will need to see a medical oncologist  a colorectal surgeon and a radiation oncologist to formulate the plan of care. Good luck. The RX of CA of the RECTUM is dependent upon the stage and precise location of the tumor. It sounds like your husband underwent an endorectal ULTRASOUND to determine the stage so as to decide if the first step should be surgery or chemotherapy + radiation therapy. Please meet w/a general/colorectal surgeon to clarify the options available. When caught early  there is a high cure rate. Good luck!

For small adenomotous polyps this is rare  for large dysplastic polyps these have a higher potential for doing so. Regardless your has been removed  you will be fine. Most colon cancers are adenocarcinomas. Thus if your polyp has adenomatous compeonents found microscopically by the pathologist  then it would be considered a precancerous polyp or if iot showed microscopic evidence of dysplasia it too would be considered precancerous.

2657	Q:828608A:1252604	What is the difference with a deviated septum and a nasal polyp? A deviated septum is when the septum  the sheet of cartilage down the middle of your nose  is no longer straight  and twists to one side or the other.  A polyp is a little benign growth inside the nose.  So  they are different - but they can both cause blockage of the airflow through your nose.  Evaluation by an ENT doctor can help you figure this out. The septum is a cartilage and bone structure inside your nose that separates the sides. It may be bent and block breathing. A nasal polyp is a soft growth that usually originates in the sinus  is caused by inflammation and may also block breathing. They can occur together.

The answer to your question depends on the pathology report on the polyp.  Ask your doctor to discuss the pathology with you. Polyps can be everything from benign to precancerous to actual cancer. Then ask him his recommendations for followup.  It could be anything from active surveilance (repeat colonoscopy 3-5 years) to surgery. The risk of there being cancer in a polyp is correlated with the size and type of polyp. Polyps resected by colonoscopies have a risk of leaving tissue behind that remains suspect.

It isn't  however  necessarily a good thing  since it shows that you are a polyp-maker. This may increase your risk of cancer if you are not followed properly. Usually 3 or more polyps means you should have a repeat colonoscopy within a year or two. It is not odd to have several polyps removed at the time of a colonoscopy. The intent is to remove all polyps found unless you happen to have familial polyposis in which case there may be thousands of polyps and obviously they can't all be removed.

Are you done havin children?  Are you sterilized?  If so talk to him about an endometrial ablation. If the periods are regular but heavy more likely the cause is something physical with the uterus  such as from the fibroid or adenomyosis. Treatment is usually a procedure such as removing the fibroid (abdominally or through the vagina  which depends on size and position) or hysteroscopy with ablation or uterine artery embolization. Speak with a gynecologist. You should try Mirena IUD At age 30  the likely causes are the cervical polyp and/or the fibroid. These tend to bleed and heal and bleed again. If the D&C debrided all the tissue  then it is a mystery. Possibly  the procedure left behind some abnormal remnants of the fibroid  and may need to be re debrided.

A polyp is essentially a soft skin tag ( unlike a fibroid) and may cause some irregular bleeding on occasion but is unlikely to prevent implantation/ cause miscarriage unless the embryo attempts to implant directly over it  again highly unlikely. Polyps are fairly common (about 10% of my infertility pts). We usually remove them because there is evidence that they cause infertility and they are easy to remove. The research links them to infertility and poss miscarriage but does not prove it. Thus controversy. Most fertility specialists I know would remove them before treatment. I hope this helps. Not a great probability to cause infertility or miscarriage  but it's an easy fix and will improve your percentages.

2690	Q:749006A:1135557	What is the likelyhood of a sudden polyp in gallbladder being cancer after colon cancer in person with lynch syndrome? I know of no relation between Lynch syndrome affecting the colon and the gallbladder. Gallbladder polyps are not a   sudden   condition. Small gallbladder polyps are observed &amp; likely only represent cholesterolosis of the lining of the gallbladder. Gallbladder polyps of greater than 1 cm can be resolved with laparoscopic gallbladder surgery. Because Lynch syndrome is caused by defects  in DNA repair  there is increased risk of cancers not only of the colon and rectum but gastric  bile ducts  prostate  etc.  If a newly diagnosed polyp is found in GB  it should be removed to eliminate this possibility.

Stomach or gastric polyps are not very common &amp; generally observed with medical treatment after a biopsy to be sure it is benign. Colon cancer develops in another organ  the large intestine. Polyps can grow into cancer in the colon &amp; polyps can regrow. Some colon cancers are very flat and can be difficult to see on colonoscopy until they become large enough. It may be that the polyposis syndrome that you are dealing with may be more extensive. Frequently  when people speak about gastrointestinal polyposis  it may involve more than one part of the GI tract. Thus  although the stomach was treated  there may have been more polyps elsewhere. Alternatively  you may also explain this by postulating two separate entities or sites for cancer to start.

Should I the patient remove it a day or two after surgery I usually have the patient or family member remove the packing 1-2 days after surgery for rectal abscess.  You should check with your surgeon however just to be sure. I assume you had drainage of an abscess with packing.  This shouldn't stay in more than a day or two as it interferes with drainage.  Some surgeons pack to stop bleeding and this should only be needed overnight.  Some surgeons don't pack at all and just put a dressing over the surface (this is less painful).

2734	Q:76571A:122667	I have sinus polyps. should I take steroids? Steroids may help for a very short time. Usually polyps that cause chronic symptoms are helped by surgery. Please talk to your doctor about your options. Nasal polyps are a very complex problem and many other disorders as well as other nasal masses must be ruled out.  Sometimes systemic steroids but they do have many side effects (especially with frequent or long term usage).  Topical nasal steroids can often keep them at bay but these also have some side effects as well.  You need a thorough ENT exam and perhaps allergy treatment as well. Steroids - oral and/or nasal should always be apart of any regimen for someone with a history of polyps. Surgery should be the last resort because many polyp patients need multiple surgeries. I would reserve surgery for 1) evidence of chronic sinus infections 2) nasal obstruction. Loss of smell will usually not improve after surgery.

2735	Q:615416A:917961	What is the difference of a polyp and a carceniid tumor ? A polyp is a growth arising from glandular tissue.  In the intestines they arise from the lining of the inside of intestine. There are various type of polyps  most benign  some cancerous. A carcinoid tumor can be in a polyp and is a cancerous tumor that can cause symptoms by making various hormones  in addition to tumor/mass effects. Colon polyps are common.  Most are benign Getting regular screening colonoscopy and having them removed can actually prevent cancer.   Polyps arrise from the lining of the colon.

Cerivcal polyps are almost always benign  but we still recommend their removal.  They are easy for a gynecologist to remove  so be sure to see a doctor so the polyp can be sent to a pathologist and confirm the bleeding isn&#x27;t pre-cancer or cancer.  The symptoms are most commonly bleeding after intercourse  or heavy bleeding or intermittant breakthrough bleeding.  We don&#x27;t know why they form.

2739	Q:10823A:18103	Do colon polyps hurt? Colonic polyps cause no pain.  This is why colonoscopies are so useful - you are looking for something that causes no overt symptom. Usually no.  Only rarely when a polyp grows large enough to cause some obstruction to the colon.  Most are totally painless  sometimes precancerous  and are exactly the reason everyone over 50 years of age should have a colonoscopy screening for cancer. Polyps do not hurt.  If a polyp has gotten huge  then it can block the passage of stool  called a bowel obstruction  and that can hurt.  Having a polyp removed in colonoscopy also doesn't hurt.  All people of average risk for colon cancer should be screened for the polyps at 50.  It is important not to wait until some symptom makes you get checked The typical polyp is painless. The majority of colon polyps cause no pain.  As mentioned by my colleagues  if the polyp is large enough to cause an obstruction  then you may notice symptoms of obstruction (thin stool  constipation  possible bleeding  etc.)  Any change in your normal stool habits should be checked by your physician.  In addition  the removal of polyps through a colonoscopy is also usually painless. Not typically  unless they are pedunculated and either become pulled or twisted on its stalk. They do not typically cause pain  unless they are very very large (and this would be rare).  That is why colonoscopy as a screening tool for colon polyps is so important. Colon polyps should not hurt. That is why it is important for patients over 50 and especially if there is a family history to get a colonoscopy to screen for polyps. Other than occasionally bleeding from polyps or a change in bowel habitsmost people dont know they have them. Polyps can be benign or malignant in which case they must be removed before they can turn into cancer. Most colon polyps are painless unless they are so big they cause constipation. Also large colon polyps can transform to colon cancer.

2746	Q:13588A:18111	How do polyps in the colon relate to colon cancer? All colon cancers come from colon polyps  and the development of cancer within a polyp can take several years.  Removing these polyps thereby removes the chance of getting colon cancer.  This is why colonoscopies are so useful. Polyps in the colon can be considered a precancerous condition.  Most colon polyps are benign but some have the potential to progress to cancer and should be removed.  The best way to discover and remove these polyps is colonoscopy. Some types of polyps can grow into colon cancer.  Hyperplastic polyps  which look like polyps  but are just lumps of normal tissue do not grow into cancer.  Some polyps have a greater risk of becoming cancer  and the more polyps a person has the greater the risk. Colon cancer starts out as polyps.  It could take seven or more years for a polyp to become cancer---most never do.  Screening Colonoscopies can detect and remove polyps before they may become cancerous 85 percent of colon cancers arise from colon polyps. As polyps grow  they can transform into colon cancer. Not all polyps are precancerous and not all precancerous polyps become colon cancers.

2761	Q:98596A:161506	What stage of colon cancer is polyp? Polyps are not cancer yet.  There are many forms of polyps.  Some  like tubular adenoma and villous adenoma  need a full colonoscopy  and surgery if the polyp is too large.  Hyperplastic polyps need no treatment.  Colon cancers can arise from adenomatous polyps. Neglected polys will  develop cancer  colon cancer also starts as colon cancer with out being polyp. Polyp only means a grape like structure protruding into the lumen of an organ.  Some cancers appear polypoid.  Histologically confirmed benign polyp  by a pathologist  is a pre-cancerous lesion.

2765	Q:57639A:196180	Can balloon surgery be performed for Nasal polyps? Nasal polyps do not respond well to ballon sinuplasty Polyps can sometimes be treated with steroids  be they inhaled or orally taken or injected.  Sinuplasty opens up sinuses but don&#x27;t change polyps.  Individuals with polyps should consider seeing an allergist to see what they are allergy to  as often controlling allergies will lessen polyps  or at least the recurrence of polyps if surgery has been performed. Balloon sinuplasty is indicated for recurrent/chronic sinusitis. IT IS NOT indicated for polyps. In fact in the setting of polyps  balloon sinuplasty is relatively contraindicated. Balloon sinuplasty is a nice way of opening blocked sinuses. Polyp disease is not an issue of blocked sinuses the way pain or recurrent infection might be. Polyps are from nasal and sinus inflammation. The balloon procedure won't stop your particular nose from being inflamed.

Yes  a rectal tumor can involve other contiguous structure by direct invasion without lymphatic involvement.  &quot;Neoplastic lymphoid follicles&quot; are lymphoid tissue or nodes with tumor involvement. Cancer of the Rectum can spread into cervix but only by local extension which is not the case here. I suspect the polyp in the cervix is unrelated to the Rectal ca which is quite early in this case.

2790	Q:556732A:834165	What is the likelihood of colon cancer if you have a 1.5cm polyp? Here size doesn't matter. It is the cell type seen by the Pathologist under the microscope that is important. Hopefully yours is benign and it sounds like you were fortunate to find a smaller polyp that could be removed successfully. If this is all you have in your colon on your colonoscopy  you then need to have it biopsied to determine if it is cancerous or prrecancerous.

2832	Q:328293A:735034	What are sessile polyps found in colon sent to pathology? Sessile or low lying  non-pedunculated polyps are still of uncertain pathology until sent for microscopic diagnosis. They may be benign ranging to carcinoma (less commonly). Beyond that  there is one sessile polyp that has specific premalignant potential the cecum/right colon called a sessile serrated adenoma  but these are fairly uncommon (associated with micro satellite instability). Flat (sessile) polyps have a risk of being pre-malignant (tubular adenoma or sessile serrated adenoma) or malignant (colon carcinoma). The only way to be sure is to send the biopsy sample to pathology to be interpreted and diagnosed. polps ore flat polyps as compared to pedunculated polyps which have a stalk or stem. Both have potential to be pre cancerous or cancerous and therefore all polyps should be evaluated by a pathologist and all should be removed at colonoscopy. Sessile refers to the morphology of the polyp rather than the polyp type. Sessile polyps are more flat than peduculated polyps  which grow from a stalk. Once removed  the polyp is sent to pathology to determine the polyp type (hyperplastic  adenoma  cancer  etc).

2833	Q:192170A:279072	I have abdominal pain  anemia  liver hemangioma  and gallbladder polyp. should i be worried about cancer? It's not clearly cancer from what you're saying  although i can see why you would be worried. But more workup is needed. It sounds to me that you have had a lot of tests to evaluate your abdominal pain.  The polyp (if <1cm) is of no concern; ditto the hemangioma (if<4cm).  Anemia requires a formal evaluation to identify the cause.  Abdominal pain  likewise  requires a thorough evaluation to get to the bottom of this.  I suggest you see your primary care doctor to help connect the dots and understand the next steps. Abdominal pain and anemia  if you are over the age of 50 should raise the suspicion of cancer.  If you haven't had a recent colonoscopy  this would be a good idea.  Gallbladder polyps unless they are about 5-6 mm in size are usually harmless.  Liver hemangiomas don't have an appreciable cancer risk.  It would be good to make an appointment with a gastroenterologist.

2835	Q:323677A:470911	can MRI distinguish between fibroid and polyp in uterus? Transvaginal ultrasound with saline infusion (SISH) is a better test  and done by the gyn specialist who can treat you. Saline sonohysterography is the test to evaluate endometrial polyp vs. submucosal fibroid. A tiny straw is inserted in to the uterine cavity followed by a transvaginal ultrasound probe in vagina. Sterile water is instilled while watching the water separate the front and back walls of the uterine cavity on ultrasound. It can detect tiny polyps too small to see on regular ultrasound or MRI.

2837	Q:176338A:287444	How do they do nasal polyp removal? Are you out? Each rhinologist uses their own technique.  This may vary from the use of forceps  rotatory instruments  rarely laser  and finally snares.The technique is not as important as the surgeon's skill.  Usually surgery is reserved for major polyp growth which blocks breathing and smell and has not responded to good medical therapy.  Good surgery has risks which you need to know about. I failed to answer you last question.  Obviously  you have to ask your surgeon.  I feel that it is much easier to remove massive nasal polyposis under general anesthesia in a hospital setting. Even if the polyps are small  there is always a danger of bleeding if it is performed as an office procedure. Nasal polyps are usually removed endoscopicly with you asleep.

If your polyp grew by 50% in 6 months  that would be a criteria for the removal of your gallbladder.  It never hurts to get a second surgical opinion  especially with elective surgery. Gallbladder polyps can act like polyps in other parts of the GI tract.  More than likely this will be benign but because of interval growth I would recommend that it be removed.  We used to consider 1.0cm polyps as the absolute indication.  Some surgical literature does suggest 8mm be the cutoff.  Gallbladder cancer is difficult to treat vs. removal of a polyp.

2868	Q:496735A:741162	What is a Adenomatous colon polyp.? Adenomatous polyps are pre cancerous growths in the lining of the colon.  Think of them as the colonic equivalent of benign moles on your skin.  Just as some people have lots of moles  some people make lots o polyps.     Adenoma refers to glandular growth.  These can usually be removed during colonoscopy.  Removing them prevents them from becoming a colon cancer As opposed to a hyperplastic polyp  an adenomatous polyp is the type of growth in your colon that can become cancerous over time.  Variants such as villous or tubulo-villous adenomas may also describe this type of polyp.  If you have these removed at colonoscopy  you will require surveillance on a regular basis.

2870	Q:593261A:883015	Is there a way to balance estrogen levels without HRT.? 40 yrs old.  Too much estrogen. Polyp on uterus.  Somewhat rough periods. Will ablation help? An endometrial ablation is a procedure to destroy the lining of the uterus to eliminate or minimize the amount of bleeding during menstrual cycles. There are five different techniques and most can be done in the office under local anesthesia. This does not affect your hormones or cause menopause. It is a great option and helps patients avoid major surgery. There may be several reasons a polyp forms in the uterine cavity. A hysteroscopy (outpatient procedure) and then an ablation may remove it and lessen the chance of it coming back. In some cases natural progesterone may counteract estrogen action on the uterine lining and help difficult periods.

2873	Q:173726A:287463	Nasal polyp removal absolutely necessary or can one wait (for how long)? If there are no severe symptoms or invasion toward the eye or brain then it can be delayed until any of the above develop If the polyps are small and not blocking breathing  medical therapy with oral steroids or topical steroids may be sufficient.  Major sinus surgery always is the last thing you should have done.  Surgery is performed when medical therapy has failed and your quality of life is very poor.  The length of waiting therefore depends on your symptoms.  Polyps are almost always a benign disease. In addition to what Dr. Bernstein Joel answered:  do you have any signs or symptoms associated with sleep apnea? If so  some cases have been cured or relieved by the removal of nasal polyps.

2877	Q:36298A:31224	How quickly do colon polyps grow? Polyps generally grow slowly  taking years to get big enough to be visible. However  there do seem to be some that are faster growing and more aggressive. I have certainly seen them show up in less than a year after a previous colonoscopy. Generally we discuss polyp growth as being exponential  so that  from a single cell to  a polyp 1 cubic centimeter in size probably takes 2-3 years. hyoweveer due the exponential growth they can double in size in shorter times. Some polyp types may be faster growing than others.

2893	Q:173725A:249301	Best hospital or clinic for nasal polyp removal? I think the surgeon you pick is most important  as they should have extensive experience doing advanced nasal and sinus surgery endoscopically under computer aided image guidance.  I routinely perform minimally invasive image guided endoscopic sinus surgery and am known as one of the foremost surgeons in this field on the west coast. There are many sites throughout the country. Your surgeon is more important than the hospital. They should have stereotactic surgery available as this means computer guided surgery. This newer technology makes polyp removal in advanced and more complex cases safer and easier. Many otolaryngologist in group or solo practice or affiliated with a hospital have a wealth of experience in nasal polypectomy  endoscopic sinus surgery with or without sinuplasty.

U Gynecologist  will be the one to answer U  best It is unlikely to be cancer at your age  but you should have the polyp biopsied and removed.  This will likely help with the heavy bleeding and give an answer about cancer.  It is a minor procedure that can be done in the office sometimes  but likely an outpatient surgery.  The cyst can be followed on ultrasound and may be normal function of the ovary  but if it grows or changes may removal. If your physician hasn't already done an endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy with D&C  he or she needs to do so.  Ultrasound alone can't rule out pre-cancer or cancer of the uterus  it simply reveals polyps  fibroids or ovarian cysts.  If the biopsy is normal  then you may elect to try oc's  lysteda  or undergo an endometrial ablation for the treatment of your abnormal bleeding.

If the polyp was negative for malignancy including the base  then this uptake would probably be inflammatory in nature (healing cells). show where there are metabolically active cells  not just cancer cells.  So it probably means that your colon is still trying to heal from the polyp removal  and healing cells are metabolically active.  I would not worry too much if your polyp was benign.

2956	Q:10817A:98711	Are colon polyps cancerous? Colon polyps may  on occasion  contain cancers. That is why we are screened by colonoscopy  and polyps are removed during colonoscopy. There are different types of colon polyps.  Some will not turn into cancer.  But many (adenomatous polyps in particular) have a high likelihood of turning into cancer if not removed.  We think that most colon cancers start as polyps. That is why we recommend colonoscopy at age 50. If you have a precancerous polyp  it can be removed before you get cancer.

The nurse was likely referring to an adenomatous polyp  a common type of colon polyp that  if it had not been removed  could have turned into cancer some day.  The polyp has presumably been removed and is no longer a danger to you. However  you (and any mother  father  brother  sister  son or daughter) are at elevated risk to form more polyps and will need to have more closer follow up exams. Adenomas are precancerous polyps that grow in the colon.  These polyps do NOT contain cancer.  However  if not removed  they have the potential to become cancerous down the road.

2959	Q:88475A:147045	New to the US. Doctor says I have colonic polyps. Please comment.? Colon polyps are precancerous tumors of the colon which have the potential of becoming cancer if  not removed.  They do not generally cause symptoms.  Removing polyps decreases your risk of cancer.  With a history of colon polyps you are at higher risk of forming polyps in the future and your doctor should have scheduled you for appropriate follow up colonoscopy (usually 3-5 years) in the future. IF you have colon polyps  they need to be removed with a colonoscopy. Once removed and analized your doctor should tell you when to have a follow up colonoscopy to see if new polyps have formed. Nearly all colon cancers start off as a polyp. Most polyps are not cancerous but can grow and cause bleeding and obstruction. polyps are often found on colonoscopy. if they are removed (which they should be)  they will be sent to a pathologist  who can make sure they are not cancerous. if they are benign  nothing more is needed except a follow up colonoscopy in 3-5 years. if the polyp is cancerous  more treatment including surgery is likely required.

Most important is the type of polyp.  Hyperplastic polyps are not malignant and are not the concern that we associate with adenomatous polyps which can be premalignant.  Most worrisome are adenomatous polyps with atypia which should be aggressively removed.  Many invasive  cancers start as a benign polyp and can be prevented by polypectomy!

2963	Q:69015A:126711	how can you tell the difference between a uterine fibroid and polyp? I took birth control pills on and off for a couple months. an ultrasound done vaginally of the female organs can identify fibroids. a saline infused sonogram is similar but saline (salt water) is gently infused into the uterus during the ultrasound with a small tube which allows polyps in the uterine cavity to be seen. polyps are usually benign but can cause irregular bleeding. Fibroids can cause periods to be very heavy  and long. Using ultrasound your doctor can usually tell the difference between a polyp and a fibroid. Sometimes this can be challenging and a special ultrasound which uses saline infusion can be done. This is called a sonohystogram. This allows better visualization of the inside or cavity of the uterus. If we still are not sure we can look directly using a video camera called a hysteroscope.

2965	Q:104852A:166714	Are nasal polyps ever cancerous or turn cancerous? are usually associated with chronic inflammation of the nose caused by allergies or chronic sinusitis- they are benign. Rarely  other disease can mimic nasal polyps such as an inverting papilloma (IP). IP is a locally aggressive tumor and although benign  can progress to a malignancy in a small percentage of cases.If polyp occurs only on one side  bleeds  painful- see your doctor for further eval. Papillomas in the nose look like nasal polyps and become cancerous in 5-15% of cases. Normal nasal polyps do not. Common nasal polyps are usually due to allergy and do not become cancerous.

Wouldn't the bleeding stop eventually or could it be endless? most of the cervical polyps are benign so normally they would leave it alone until after the pregnancy.

If this was biopsied at the time of colonoscopy it should only take 2-3 days to get results. The question will be whether it is benign  precancerous  or cancerous Waiting for test results can be torcher.  Usually it takes 3-4 days for the pathologist to prepare the speciman and then evaluate  although different labs can vary in their time.

2973	Q:79604A:129390	Which treatment works the best and fastest for colonic polyps? Polyps are generally found during colonoscopy. During this procedure they are removed or biopsied and studied by a pathologist. If they come back cancerous or cause excess bleeding or obstruction  you may be referred for removal of part of the colon. High fiber diet may or may not help prevent recurrence or cancer. During colonoscopy the doctor will snip and remove these polyps.  Often there are just a few and easily managed and the patient brought back each 5 years to look for newly formed ones that are removed.  The risk is polyps can eventually turn into colon cancers.In some people there are too many and they can not all be removed but they can be kept an eye on to catch those that may turn cancerous.

If you are on Pentasa because your doctor thinks you have ulcerative colitis then this is the expected finding.  The ulcers leave areas of normal lining that look like ulcers because of the surrounding ulcers.  These are called pseudopolyps.  Biopsies are often  needed to tell for sure.  If the ulcers are large and extensive you may need to add another medication. There are some studies suggesting that low dose aspirin may prevent polyps.

2979	Q:10810A:116323	Are colonic polyps common in children? Colon polyps are not common in children but do occur on occasion.  These polyps are generally juvenile type polyps which are not generally malignant or pre-malignant.  They frequently present with bleeding or obstructive type symptoms and can generally be removed during colonoscopy.  Rarely  especially with familial polyposis syndromes  precancerous polyps can occur in children. Adenomas which are dysplatic polyps that increase the risk for colorectal cancer are not commonly found in children.  However  wit Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and juvenile polyposis  children may have colon polyps with cancer risks. Isolated juvenile polyps (hamartomas) of the colon are common (occurring in 1 to 2 percent of children)  usually solitary  and are no risk for cancer.

2984	Q:537306A:810651	Is it possible that a vaginal ultrasound will misdiagnose a endometrial polyp?  Is it possible this is scar tissue from a fiberoil I had removed? Appearance of lesions on imaging is often suitable as a screening test  but as noted by the other physician's answer it could very well be something else. A biopsy will tell with certainty  as a polyp  leiomyoma  scar and hyperplasia  etc  all have very characteristic features on pathology. A scar in the endometrial lining of the uterus  where the sperm and egg implants   can occur after a procedure and could look similar to a polyp. A polyp will be bright on  and the scar will be less bright . A special test where fluid is inserted into the canal called a saline hystero-salpingogram can help distingusih the 2. It can be done by a radiologist or OB-GYN. I would discuss with MD Yes it is posssible.

2993	Q:87908A:143539	Do all colon cancers start as a polyp than can be found and removed on colonoscopy  or do some not have a   polyp stage  ? While removal of polyps at colonoscopy without question reduces the incidence of colon cancer  it is probably true that some of the colon cancers did not start that way.  Since detection of actual cancer takes place after they might have been in the polyp stage (or not)  then we cannot back track to see.  Your best protection is regular colonoscopies especially if you are at risk. Approximately 85% of colon cancers do start as polyps. The other 15 percent occur in cases of chronic inflammation. Cancer can develop in patients with ulcerative colitis with no polyp stage. The chronic inflammation itself can be a precancerous state.

3000	Q:55051A:72250	I think I have polyps in my nose will a steroid based spray remove them? No.  It may shrink them some but to get rid of them completely it usually requires surgery. Although  a steroid spray will probably not remove your polyps completely  it may help them shrink them significantly. It may be a good starting point option or an option for those who don't want to proceed with surgery or in whom surgery is contraindicated. I would strongly suggest neti pot nasal flushing along with the steroid spray to prevent nose bleeds and dryness. Inflammatory polyps can respond to a steroid base spray (decrease in size) but it is not often that they will disappear completely b/c the polyp is usually a manifestation of a more global inflammatory condition. For some patients  the response is adequate for others  surgery is indicated. Be sure to have the polyp evaluated  if it is only on one side  a biopsy is often indicated. If you have a good sense of smell and taste chances are that you don't have significant nasal polyps. If your sense of smell and taste are gone or diminished polyps are likely. Nasal steroids reduce inflammation and by doing so they reduce polyps which are strongly associated with nasal inflammation. It is a good first step. An ENT doctor is easily able to make the diagnosis by looking. You need to be evaluated by a Ear  Nose and Throat doc. If you indeed have nasal polyps  they need to be surgically removed.

3002	Q:10824A:64263	Does everyone show colon polyps symptoms? Cancer is now the number 1 (n˙mero UNO) cause of death age 60-79 in the US  more than cardiovascular disease. Lung cancer by far the most deadly cancer (more than colon  breast  ovarian & prostate all together). Please ask for cancer screening : colonoscopy  pap  mammogram and psa. No excuse not to be screened specially after age 50  even younger depending on family history and type of cancer Most polyps unless they are cancerous or partially obstructing the colon do not cause symptoms. African American patients should start screening colonoscopy at the age of 45  otherwise start at the age of 50 or younger if you have a family history of colon cancer. Most people with colon polyps have NO SYMPTOMS!  That's why it is so important for people to get screened when appropriate. Generally when you are 50  and maybe sooner if there is a family history of colon polyps.

3003	Q:10809A:277467	I feel colonoscopy is invasive.  Are there less embarrassing ways to look for colonic polyps? Yes  but none that are better than colonoscopy.  With colonoscopy  not only do you get the diagnostic test done  but if a polyp is found  it is easily removed.  Other tests do not give you that benefit. There is a procedure called virtual colonoscopy.  It is less embarrassing  but if it does find polyps then one has to have a traditional colonoscopy to test/ remove these polyps and you still have to use the same bowel prep. Insurance payment is rare for this procedure when used for screening.  And although the colonoscopy seems embarrassing  the medications used allow you to be comfortable. There is another test  CT Colonoscopy  which can identify polyps.  There are several problems with this approach  however.  There is radiation involved  which can be quite high.  If a polyp is identified  then a regular colonoscopy must be done to remove it  and only after it is removed can it be looked at in pathology to see if it has the potential to turn into cancer.  The prep is the same. Another test is the stool analysis for minute amounts of blood  which can be an early sign of polyps.  There are test under development which also use a stool sample to check for genetic markers of higher risk  but they are not widely used.  If there is blood  then a colonoscopy would be needed. A qualified   yes   - there are alternatives - the barium enema  and the virtual colonoscopy  but long story short  they're just not as accurate as the traditional colonoscopy.  Even the virtual colonoscopy might miss smaller but potentially precancerous polyps. If you are screening for colon cancer the United States Task Force on Preventative Health recommends one of three methods  sigmoidoscopy   colonoscopy or fecal occult blood testing (FOBT).  They should start in average risk patients at age 50.  No one method has been shown to be superior for colon cancer screening.  Discuss the options with your physician. sure you can do a virtual - but if you find something that needs a biopsy - its back to the prep and then get ready for the scope - so might as well get over it and do it right the first time  - An alternative is a virtual colnonscopy but this still involves having a catheter inserted into your rectum to inject dye followed by a CT scan. Stool blood testing can be done but it is nonspecific. Positive stool blood testing commonly leads to colonoscopies. Remember you are   asleep   for a colonoscopy. Patients can also undergo a special ct scan-also known as virtual colonoscopy to look for colon polyps. Unfortunately  if one sees polyps on virtual colonoscopy  then one still needs to undergo the real colonoscopy to remove them. For a full evaluation of your colon  a virtual colonoscopy or CT colonography may be an option. This is a specialized examination using the CT scanner performed by certain centers. Ask your doctor if this option is available in your area.

On the other hand  hyper plastic polyps are generally considered benign and not pre cancerous. But until the polyp is removed and evaluated by pathology after a colonoscopy  the diagnosis can not be made. Plain CT would not find a polyp (especially a hyperplastic polyp which tend to be small and in the left colon and rectum). CT colonography (  virtual colonoscopy  ) may show a polyp in the cecum  if it is at least 6mm in size; can't really see things smaller than that.  and can't biopsy anythingseen w/o colonoscopy.

If you believe you have a nasal polyp  you should see your ENT (Ear  Nose and Throat) doctor to confirm the diagnosis and provide you a treatment plan. You should consult a ENT specialist to look in your nostril and  find out what is making it bleed and what needs to be done.Usually polyps are assciated with nasal allergy and you may benefit from nasal steroids and antihistamines and if it is causing obstruction then you may need surgery Nasal polyps usually do not bleed.

3012	Q:677532A:1024757	23 years old with gallbladder polyp 7mm  should I be worried? Gallbladder polyps are not uncommon and usually don't cause problems. If it is a true polyp and over 10mm  there is a VERY SMALL risk of it developing into gallbladder cancer.  That's when we recommend removing the gallbladder  which is usually outpatient laparoscopic surgery. When plops are under 10mm  you just need to follow up with an ultrasound in about a year to be sure it's not growing to over 10mm.   Gallbladder cancer is extremely rare. I would repeat sonogram in 6 months in the same facility so they can compare the studies. Is polyp is increasing in size or is  more then1cm - recommend gallbladder removal. In my experience most of them turn out to be a soft GB stone.

3019	Q:189084A:291828	Are either fibroids  endometrial hyperplasia  or polyps a precursor to cancer? Examination of this tissue under a microscope can make this diagnosis. Endometrial hyperplasia that is complex with atypia (i.e.not typical) cell IS a precursor to cancer. Polyps do not usually develop cancer & the risk of cancer in a fibroid is less than 1%. All could cause abnormal bleeding & may be called DUB (Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding) until a diagnosis can be made. A polyp can be cancerous or precancerous. The exact chance of that depends on several factors including age  genetics and other medical problems. Hyperplasia has a significant risk of becoming cancer depending on whether there is atypia or not. In general fibroids are not cancerous.

Hi.Sonography of USG Pelvis showed: normal bladder but retroverted uterus(106X73X59mm). Endometiral echo seen in midline(10.7m You haven't indicated what symptoms lead to the ultrasound  but I'm guessing it was abnormal bleeding.  That's a common complication of endometrial polyps  which are benign growths on the lining of the uterus.  They are usually addressed by removal though the vagina. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of uterine muscle that can cause bleeding  pain  or pelvic/abdominal fullness.  The fact that one of them has calcium in it means that it's started to regress spontaneously.  Treatment of fibroids depends on a lot of things  including the severity of symptoms  patient age  and plans for future fertility.  Treatment can range from waiting for menopause to doing a hysterectomy.The polyp may be causing you some bleeding and the fibroids may be causing you some discomfort  but t good news is that the findings suggested by the ultrasound are benign. Sounds like uterine fibroids.  If no symptoms  nothing would need to be done about it.  If bleeding or other issues  could consider a myomectomy if you want to preserve the uterus or a hysterectomy if not.

3085	Q:19512A:66065	What is the difference in between a hemorrhoid and a polyp? A hemorrhoid is found only in the anal canal and is related to the veins of the anal canal. They are benign  although they can bleed and be painful.A polyp is a growth in the gastrointestinal tract. While they tend to grow in the colon  they can be found anywhere in the GI tract. They can get quite large. Some of them have the potential to become cancer. Colon polyps should generally be removed Both hemorrhiods and polyps are abnomalities associated with the colon. The hemorrhoid is a vein that has swelled and cause pain & itching. The polyp is an abnormal growth of the lining of the colon. it is usually painless and diagnosed incidentally on colonoscopy. Polyps can degenerate into cancer and need to be removed. Hemorroids are a nuisance and removed for reasons of bleeding or discomfort.

3088	Q:383048A:596052	On 8/30 + 9/20 i had 80mg kenalog epidural injections. lmp 8/16. on 9/16 i started spotting continuously on 10/14 at routine gyn visit i had a cervical polyp removed (path showed it was endometrial tissue) i started progesterone 10 mg x 14 days. still no It's unlikely the epidural injections contributed to your spotting. The fact that your gynecologist prescribed Provera (progesterone) implies that you had not had a normal period for at least three months prior to your October 14 visit. Secondary amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual bleeding in a woman who has previously had regular periods) is usually caused by a failure to ovulate. This  in turn  results in unopposed estrogen stimulation of your uterine lining (the endometrium) which leads to endometrial thickening and  in many cases  spotting. (By the way  cervical polyps can also cause spotting.)Provera is used to   withdraw   the lining of your uterus from the effects of estrogen and induce a period. This not only helps to reset your hormonal clock and reestablish a normal menstrual cycle; it helps prevent the development of uterine cancer. Unfortunately  this treatment doesn't work for all women  so a more potent form of progesterone (Megace) may be required. In addition  if the first course of progesterone doesn't work  gynecologists frequently perform an evaluation  such as a sonohysterogram  to get a look at the uterus and its interior.Thus  your spotting could be due to a combination of factors: Your cervical polyp may have been a contributor  and there's a good possibility that the lining of your uterus has become thickened and its outer layers are shedding. Hopefully  your next course of treatment will correct this problem.  (Since you saw your gynecologist again yesterday  your concerns may have been addressed. I hope things went well.) I am assuming you have had a pregnancy test during this  if not then your doctor should perform one if there is any possibility.  There are many causes of spotting  did your doctor think that the cervical polyp or its removal was causing your spotting?  Also spotting can be caused by our hormones being   out of whack    this is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding.  Usually progsterone will get you back into a rhythm but it sounds like that didn't happen.  I do think your doctor's ideas are good including the sonohysterogram.  I do not think the steroids are related to the spotting.

3090	Q:56971A:157576	When will I start.ovulating after a polyp was removed ? Removing a polyp shouldn't affect the ovarian cycle. The polyp is an overgrowth inside your uterus.  You should ovulate at the same time. That said  stress (like having surgery) can push back ovulation a week or two. A polyp in the uterus has no impact on ovulation.  If you were ovulating regularly before the surgery you should continue on schedule.

Mom needs full colonoscopy to look for and remove any polyps  including the one seen already. All are sent for exam under microscope. Biopsy does not mean cancer. Takes time 7-10 years  estimated  for polyp to develop into cancer. First of all  If it has been   there for 'quite some time'    it must be removed  likely in its entirety  and sent to the pathology lab for examination preferably as a biopsy.  This will help find out if it is benign  pre-cancerous  or cancerous.

3115	Q:496221A:1069247	Are the size  number  shape  and/or location of colonrectal polyps in anyway associated with likelihood of malignancy? larger polyp  in general  ismore suspicious for malignancy- although it does not mean that a small polyp can not be cancerous.  The more polyps you have the higher your likelihood that perhaps you have a familial condition that is associated with higher risk to develop colon cancer-FAP/HNPCC etc. certain shape of polyp is more suspicious than thers for malignancy. No for location. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis syndrome can presents with 100s to 1000s colonic polyps  (2/2 APC/beta-catenin mutation). Gardner's is this syndrome plus cutaneous & soft tissue neoplasms. Another pathway  Lynch syndrome (HNPCC) & Serrated adenoma syndrome (MSI pathway)  w/ latter usu affecting right colon. Peutz-Jeghers polyps are usu. in sm. bowel.  Other polyps seen on cscope are usu sporadic. The location of polyps is not related but the size and number are important as the chance of malignancy increases  with the size and number of polyps.  Smooth  uniform polyps are generally of less concern than irregular or ulcerated polyps.  All polyps should be totally removed as a large percentage of colon or rectal cancers start as a benign polyp and transform to malignancy ovet time.

Occasionally gallstones can be mistaken for polyps. Watch for abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting  fevers  and yellowing of the skin which should be reported to your physician immediately. The vast majority of GB polyps are indeed benign.  Any polyp less than 10mm is considered inconsequential.

3125	Q:32766A:50122	Are fibroids  endometrial hyperplasia  or polyps a precursor to cancer? Fibroids and polyps are not considered to be precursors to cancer but these can cause a variety of symptoms such as discomfort and irregular bleeding. Cancers can occasionally present as a polyp. Endormetrial hyperplasia  on the other hand  represent a spectrum from benign to increasingly worrisome but can be managed with a variety of treatment options depending on the type and how bad it is. Fibroids are benign growths of uterine muscle and are not cancerous. Rarely  a fast growing fibroid may in fact be a sarcoma or a cancer. A uterine polyp (like a skin tag in the uterus) can be totally benign or may house hyperlastic cells. Endometrial hyperplasia with atypical cells is considered precancerous and should be treated. Bleeding after menopause should always be evaluated.

3126	Q:109172A:174382	Do all polyps need to be removed in colonoscopy to avoid colon cancer? When you have a colonoscopy and polyps are found- as much as possible  all those polyps- especially the ones that are quite large and look suspicious- would need to be removed ( if possible)  to prevent the risk to develop into something more serious- like cancer. Most but not all polyps are precancerous and need to be removed. Not all polyps are pre-canerous  most are.  The determination of whether the polyp is precancerous or not usually requires examination by a pathologist and that necessitates removal.  There is no good reason to not remove a polyp detected on colonscopy.  All most all colon cancers start in polyps  therefore it is necessary to remove polyps to prevent colon cancer.

3131	Q:1251A:148042	What is Meningitis? The brain is covered with support structures called meninges.  These membranes are bathed in cerebral spinal fluid.  When infection develops in the meninges  cells and germs spill into the spinal fluid.  A spinal tap and analysis of the spinal fluid can reveal inflammation and can show the bacteria or virus that causes the infection.  Infection of the brain is encephalitis. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges).  The infection ban be bacterial  viral or fungal. Meningitis refers to infection of the fluid surrounding the brain. It is a very serious illness that can result in permanent brain damage and deafness. It may start with flu like symptoms and then rapidly progress to involve infection in the brain. Some children may have vomiting for no apparent reason  stiff neck  severe lethargy or irritability. Occasionally a purplish rash may appear. PART II- Meningitis doesn't involve brain tissue; otherwise  the brain would be inflamed and cause an ENCEPHALITIS. Confusion/Altered mental status is the hallmark of this latter diagnosis. Of course  if both the meninges and brain tissue are inflamed  we can call it a MENINGO-ENCEPHALITIS. Again  several micro-organisms and other non-infectious processes can cause these diagnoses. Part 1: Great question. It specifically refers to the inflammation of a protective layer of the brain and spinal cord called the meninges. Clinically  movements that stretch this layer (i.e. bending the neck forward) will be painful. IT can be caused by several microbes such as bacteria  fungi  and viruses. A lumbar puncture is the gold standard in obtaining spinal fluid for testing of meningitis.

3134	Q:21497A:117054	Does meningitis have progressive stages? The earliest signs of meningitis are fever stiff neck.  Course progresses through elevation of temperature  altered state of alertness and responding  seizures  and symptoms that may appear like a stroke and abnormalities of cognitive ability.  .  Untreated or if treatment is not effective  course may lead to death. The natural history of meningitis depends on the causal agent.  for example  meningococcal meningitis can progress rapidly with the patient becoming gravely ill over a period of 24 to 48 hours.   Other types of meningitis may progress more slowly.  Host factors also play a role.  Persons with impaired immune function may be more susceptible  and become ill more quickly.

3140	Q:8262A:397327	What are the signs and symptoms of viral meningitis? The symptoms are similar to a bacterial meningitis - headache  nausea  vomiting  pain in the eyes from light  stiff neck  and fever. The spinal tap will show the difference between a bacterial and a viral infection  which often is very uncomfortable  but does not require more serious treatments.  Some with viral meningitis will need IV fluids  pain medications  and medication for fever. Meningitis is an inflammation of the outer coating of the brain.  A spinal tap will show inflammatory cells in spinal fluid.  Bacteria will be seen and cultured if present.  If nothing grows it is considered aseptic.  This usually means that a virus is the cause.  Special tests and cultures may or may not identify the virus.  Viruses may infect the brain itself causing encephalitis.

3152	Q:1252A:19728	What are the differences between viral and bacterial meningitis? Meningitis is an infection of the tissues surrounding the brain.  Symptoms may include fever  headache  a stiff neck (an inability to touch the chin to the chest) and a rash.  Generally bacterial meningitis is more serious than viral.  However  intravenous antibiotics and other medications are usually initiated until laboratory results and other tests confirm the cause. Bacterial meningitis is bad and can cause brain damage (with bad outcomes such as deafness  blindness  inability to do everyday activities  . . .  and possibly death).  The routine types of Viral meningitis usually resolve by themselves  with the patients returning to normal.  There are some less common types of Viral meningitis that do cause damage. These are reasons why meningitis is so serious. the presentation is similar for both.  Most viral meningitis improves without long term issues without medication.  Most bacterial meningitis is deadly if not treated promptly and aggressively.

All women of child-bearing age should take  Folate .4-.5 milligrams daily for  3 months before conceiving  to lower risk of Neural Tube Defects. A follow-up visit with your doctor  checking your iron levels  etc. might be a good idea. If you are past the process there is no reason for you to delay your efforts. You can move forward when you feel the strength returning. The typical viruses that cause such a process do not hang around ready to invade you (or baby) after your body developed the antibodies needed to heal your brain & system.

3157	Q:22230A:1269952	What are the ways that bacterial meningitis is transmitted? Bacterial meningitis is mildly contagious  and it spreads only through close contact with the infected person. It spreads when a healthy person comes in contact with the infected person's saliva or nose discharges. It should be remembered that bacterial meningitis does not spread through casual contact like shaking hands or breathing the same air as the infected person.

Causes of bacterial meningitis including Strep  Neisseria  H flu &amp; viruses like enteroviruses  herpes  &amp; HIV. Bacteria &amp; viruses that cause meningitis colonize the nose &amp; throat &amp; are transmitted through respiratory droplets. Viral meningitis can also be transmitted by fecal-oral routes &amp; insect bites. Usually contacts working within ~3 ft of those with meningitis r considered to be at high risk. Most people have a distorted view of &quot;meningitis&quot; since most are familiar with the fearsome &quot;Meningococcal&quot; form  caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. In fact  many  types of  meningitis (bacteria virus  etc)  are not contagious just by merely standing beside a person.

3170	Q:88621A:150087	My doctor thinks I might have bacterial meningitis. Wants more info to confirm  but I am worried. What exactly is it? Your brain & spinal cord are surrounded by a layer of cushion like material like bubble wrap.These meninges float along within layers of sterile fluid that helps cushion your brain & cord from jaring trauma. If germs get into these layers  they can begin to attack your brain & cause death or permanent damage. The basic confirmatory test is a spinal tap  withdrawing some fluid & looking for germs. It's a bacterial infection of the lining of the brain.  A spinal tap must be done to withdraw spinal fluid to diagnose this serious infection  and IV antibiotics and hospitalization are generally required.  Regardless of the cause of your symptoms  I hope you have a speedy recovery. Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a life-threatening infection in the fluid surrounding the brain & spinal cord. Symptoms are sudden onset of fever  headache  stiff neck  vomiting often accompanied by seizures  confusion  & coma. Suspicion of BM  based on history & physical exam mandates immediate diagnostic spinal tap. If you had BM you wouldn't be surfing the Internet. Perhaps viral meningitis.

Insect bites may spread  forms of meningencephalitis such as lyme disease affecting the brain  and spread to the brain from an infection elsewhere in the body  such as bacterial ear infection spreading via the blood stream from one area to another. A variety of germs that cause meningitis can be carried by healthy folks in their nose& throat & these folks never get ill. They can pass it on to their environment thru secretions or droplets of a sneeze. A susceptable person then acquires the germ and it invades their system  often thru the sensitive linings of the nasal passages.We're not sure why some get sick & some don't.

3196	Q:8259A:397322	What is viral meningitis? Meningitis is inflammation of the tissues lining the brain and spinal cord.  It can be caused by a host of different microorganisms as well as by chemical irritants (introduced by medical procedures)  by cancers such as lymphomas  leukemias  etc.  The spinal fluid contained in the subarachnoid space formed by the meninges is used to help in determining the cause. Meningitis is an inflammation of the outer coating of the brain.  A spinal tap will show inflammatory cells in spinal fluid.  Bacteria will be seen and cultured if present.  If nothing grows it is considered aseptic.  This usually means that a virus is the cause.  Special tests and cultures may or may not identify the virus.  Viruses may infect the brain itself causing encephalitis.

3246	Q:109258A:174639	Can you get meningitis if your eardrum bursts and infection gets into your brain? If your eardrum bursts  the infection will drain out  away from your brain. To get to your brain  the infection would have to eat thru a bone behind the ear drum  & if the drum ruptured  all the infected material would be draining the other way. Any infection which spreads to the brain is serious  and can lead to meningitis and potentially a brain abscess.

3257	Q:920574A:1316870	What is meningitis? The most common form of meningitis is an infection (usually bacterial) that affects the surface of the brain and spinal cord (ie. the meninges). It is manifest by organisms in the cerebrospinal fluid(CSF). These are rapidly fulminant and can lead to death or severe neurological disability. The classic symptoms include high fever  stiff neck  altered mental status  rash. This is an emergency. Meningitis is an infection of the brain and the dura  a membrane that covers the brain. The typical symptoms associated with meningitis are fever  altered mental status (confusion) and lethargy - it is a serious problem and needs urgent treatment. Meningitis is an infection of the brain  involving the meninges  the fibrous covering of the brain and the brain itself.  It is a serious condition and may cause damage to the brain and in turn brain function.

3260	Q:493926A:738553	Is it possible to have meningitis without a bad headache and having a normal CBC ? You can have an aseptic or viral meningitis without severe symptoms but the headache is usually more than mild.  The much more serious bacterial or fungal causes of meningitis cause very severe symptoms including fever  chills  headache  stiff neck  altered mental status and seizures. Meningitis is really uncommon if you not terribly ill. The only way to exclude it as the source of headache is to perform lumbar puncture. There are many more common causes of chronic headache. Rarely some fungal meningitis or neoplastic meningitis may not cause a headache. If you are you immunocompromised you may not mount enough of an immune response to have a headache. pts with some forms of viral meningitis may have confusion  problems with balance or memory  or unusual movements but never complain of a headache.Normal CBC is common in viral infections Aseptic meningitis  Bacteria  CBC  Chills  Complete blood count  Fever  Headache  Neck  Seizure  Stiff neck CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Immunocompromised  Lumbar  Lumbar puncture  Puncture wound  Meningitis CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Meningitis Aseptic meningitis  Bacteria  CBC  Chills  Complete blood count  Fever  Headache  Neck  Seizure  Stiff neck CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Immunocompromised  Lumbar  Lumbar puncture  Puncture wound  Meningitis CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Meningitis Aseptic meningitis  Bacteria  CBC  Chills  Complete blood count  Fever  Headache  Neck  Seizure  Stiff neck CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Immunocompromised  Lumbar  Lumbar puncture  Puncture wound  Meningitis CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Meningitis Aseptic meningitis  Bacteria  CBC  Chills  Complete blood count  Fever  Headache  Neck  Seizure  Stiff neck CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Immunocompromised  Lumbar  Lumbar puncture  Puncture wound  Meningitis CBC  Complete blood count  Headache  Meningitis
3261	Q:22008A:75967	Is meningitis a dangerous disease? Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain.  Some cases are mild and with minimal symptoms.  Some cases can kill before treatment can be given.  The most important issue is index of suspicion.  If symptoms suggest meningitis  spinal tap must be performed and treatment started for the most likely etiology.  With appropriate management there can be excellent outcome. Meningitis is defined as an inflamation(generally caused by infection) of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord.The agent may be bacterial (like strep/staph/meningococcus); viral fungal or parocitic.Some viral cases are mild & resolve without special rx. Most bacterial are deadly if untreated  & may damage even with Rx. Fungal & paracitic causes are also deadly & often harder to rx.

3262	Q:21880A:1249669	Is bacterial meningitis curable? A cure with any infection depends on recognition and proper treatments. Most forms of bacterial meningitis are treatable  although such odd germs like tuberculosis may have a foothold and be hard to cure without some residual damage. The earlier the recognition & rx the better the outcome. Broad spectrum antibiotics that cross into the brain are started and continued based on culture results. Antibiotics are available for treatment.  The earlier treatment is started  the greater the possibility of cure without long term consequences.  However  f treatment is delayed  the likelihood of significant neurologic damage increases.  Death may occur if antibiotic treatment is delayed.  Some bacteria are so virulent that they may cause death shortly after infection begins.

3269	Q:31837A:79479	Will an abscess of the tonsils lead to spinal meningitis? There is a chance for anything  but it would be extraordinarily difficult to contract spinal meningitis in this way. An abscess of the tonsils is actually an abscess in the space around the tonsils  hence the correct name   peritonsillar abscess.   The peritonsillar space is a potential space that is made of  thin tissue layers called fascia. This space communicates directly with other deep neck spaces  including the pre vertebral space.

There are two brands however  Menactra and Menveo  but they are essentially approved for the same purpose with slight differences only. A vaccine is a set of proteins that trigger your body to produce antibodies against a certain agent.  In this case it is the agent that causes meningococcal infections.  The most serious meningococcal infection is the one that involves the meninges of the brain.  This becomes meningococcal meningitis.

3288	Q:711271A:1072392	What mental issues does viral meningitis cause? There are numerous viruses that can cause a broad spectrum of issues. Herpes virus can be devastating  JC virus can cause death (immunocompromised patients) while some viruses cause headache for a while with no long lasting effect. Should not be producing mental abnormalities if viral.  If the cerebrocortical tissues are involved this is now meningoencephalitis and can produce devastating and permanent injuries.  Need to define what is going on and have meaningful discussion with doctor. Real viral meningitis may be excruciating but it is unlikely to cause damage long-term.

3294	Q:338868A:478256	In 2003  I had an epidural while I gave birth; the baby later died of Aseptic Meningitis. Should I be concerned about epidurals possibly causing this? Sorry about your loss. Your loss. No  you should not be concerned. It is extremely unlikely that your epidural caused this tragedy. Epidurals are placed using a sterile technique.  Meningitis in the recipient of an epidural is a rare complication. I am very sorry about your child.  Death in a child is never acceptable.  However  you must not feel guilt or find fault.  Meningitis happens  and cause is often never found.  Epidurals must be done carefully and appropriately.  They may cause meningitis in you - but not in the child.

While the mortality rate of appropriately treated bacterial meningitis is about 5%  the chance of morbidity (complications) is up to 40%. The change of long-term neurologic problems (movement problems  thinking problems  visual or hearing loss  and seizures) ranges from about 10-15%. The chance of these things occurring  varies due to many different factors. Before we had the multiple vaccines we have today  bacterial meningitis was quite common. Delays in dx can still mean tragic permanent disability or death. Early Dx & Rx reduce long term problems. Today I look for hearing or seizure problems( some they grow out of) or other signs of subtile change. The majority that are treated agressively do well.

3312	Q:551199A:829490	I've had a bad cold with fever but the fevers gone.. My neck has been hurting and my head is just stopped up. It couldn't be meningitis could it? Meningitis is most often associated with fevers  neck stiffness  light sensitivity and headaches. Just a painful neck and head congestion is not suggestive of meningitis though it doesn't rule out an atypical presentation. No.  You are having residuals from a cold virus.  With meningitis you would have a rapid downhill progression of symptoms with continued fever  severe neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity)  photophobia (light sensitivity) and other severe symptoms.  See your doctor if you are continued to be worried. Not my area of expertise  but here is what I think: you passed through a viral infection (it is the flu season)  it is normal to experience neck lymph node swelling and of course to be congested. A definite diagnosis could only be obtained by a spinal tap (cerebral spinal fluid). An old timers rule of thumb is: can you bend your neck so as to touch your chin to chest?

3393	Q:1248A:1247228	What are the complications associated with Meningitis? Brain damage  hearing loss  cerebral palsy  mental retardation hydrocephalus and death are all complications of bacterial meningitis.  That is why prevention with vaccination against HIB  Pneumococcus (Prevnar vaccine) and Meningococcus (with the Menveo or Menactra vaccine) is so important. Bacterial meningitis can cause brain damage (with bad outcomes such as deafness  blindness  inability to do everyday activities  . . .  and possibly death).  The routine types of Viral meningitis usually resolve by themselves  with the patients returning to normal.  There are some less common types of Viral meningitis that do cause damage.  These are reasons why meningitis is a serious illness. Complications of meningitis that is not treated early include deafness  brain damage  loss of a limb (particularly if it is meningococcal meningitis) and potentially death. Meningitis is a very serious  life-threatening illness that in some cases may be prevented by immunization. Early treatment is paramount to preventing any of the potential life threatening complications.

Sneezing can be from lots of things  including allergies (which are not contagious) and viruses (which are very contagious).  A sneeze from a baby is no different than a sneeze from other people.  It could cause a cold.  Or you could have both been exposed to the virus a week ago and you will have symptoms tomorrow.  Working with kids=getting colds.  Meningitis is not related unless he has that. many people will be the target of a sneeze without experiencing any illness.  Common colds are transmitted by droplet infection such as through a sneeze   While meningitis can be transmitted by droplet infection  It is unlikely for you to develop meningitis unless the chidl had it.

3410	Q:1246A:10282	Is Meningitis contagious? Meningitis is contagious. It is typically caused by viruses or bacteria  but other  more rare causes  do occur. Viral meningitis is usually less severe and may not need medication (some does)  but all other types will need urgent medical care within the hospital. Meningitis is usually caused by viruses or bacteria.  These germs are contagious  and are spread most likely by close contact with ill persons (such as living in the same home  coughing and sneezing on one another  being the caretaker of an ill person  etc. . . .). Certain forms like meningococcal meningitis are contagious  other forms like western equine encephalitis virus meningitis aren't contagious. It is highly contagious - so much so that contacts to certain types of bacterial meningitis need antibiotics just because they've come into contact with the meningitis. The guidelines are best interpreted for your case by your provider  so a phone call is a great idea if you're concerned. There are several agents that cause infectious meningitis and all are contagious.The 3 major bacterial agents have preventative vaccines that have eliminated most cases of these diseases in the U.S.  saving thousands of lives. In some cases  antibiotics given to exposed people may prevent the spread. If you are concerned consult with your doctor Meningitis is swelling around the brain that is caused by a virus or bacteria.  There are vaccines against some types of meningitis.  These include the pneumococcal  meningococcal  and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) (not related to the seasonal flu!) vaccines. Meningitis can be spread from person to person through close contact.  Contacts should be treated if meningitis is diagnosed. Yes.  Most common forms of meningitis (viral and bacterial) are contagious  although some causes are insignificantly infective (like fungal causes).  Remember  some causes of bacterial meningitis can be prevented with vaccines. Bacterial infections that cause meningitis spread by droplet infection that is inhaled.  Viral infections are spread by a similar mechanism although some forms of meningo-encephalitis are insect born.  Fungal infections are acquired from the environment and usually are not transferred form person to person.  Persons with immune deficiency are at greatest risk for acquiring meningitis from others Although some types are more contagious than others  the three most common types of bacterial meningitis all have vaccines available to reduce the risk. There are no vaccines for viral meningitis  but fortunately viral meningitis is typically less serious than bacterial.

3465	Q:126406A:211471	What are long-term effects of bacterial meningitis? Bacterial meningitis has the nasty tendency to produce a specific set of problems depending on how soon it was detected &amp; how effective it was treated. Hearing loss was common  brain abscesses can lead to seizures &amp; or movement problems (CP)   learning disabilities &amp; the like. As an adult  you either have some of these issues or not. They would have been apparent by school age at the latest. Hearing loss  alterations in a wide range of neurological functions can occur.  These are predominantly due to inflammation of the sheath of blood vessels entering the brain through the subarachnoid space (which the meninges surround).  With brain swelling  herniation of the brain stem can occur  usually fatally.  The type of damage will depend upon which areas of brain are attacked.

3471	Q:8255A:426594	How is bacterial meningitis diagnosed? The standard for diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is the lumbar puncture. In the procedure  a needle is inserted in the lower back to get CSF which is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. That fluid is then tested for infection. Clinical appearance often raises the suspicion of meningitis. Confirmation is based on the results of a spinal tap. Fluid is removed from the spinal canal below the end of the spinal cord with a needle & sent to the lab for analysis. Tests can confirm the presence of meningitis & provide material that can be used to identify the germ & best treatment options.

3475	Q:8263A:397325	How is viral meningitis diagnosed? There are changes in the spinal fluid in cells  protein and glucose.  There is a difference sometimes in the clinical presentation.  Sometimes you can isolate the virus or detect its presence by antigen or antibody testing. Meningitis is an inflammation of the outer coating of the brain.  A spinal tap will show inflammatory cells in spinal fluid.  Bacteria will be seen and cultured if present.  If nothing grows it is considered aseptic.  This usually means that a virus is the cause.  Special tests and cultures may or may not identify the virus.  Viruses may infect the brain itself causing encephalitis.

3479	Q:8267A:112985	How can I reduce my chances of becoming infected with viruses that can lead to viral meningitis? Meningitis is becoming more common  although rare  particularly in tight quarters such as college dorms. Meningococcal vaccines protect against most types of meningitis  but they do not prevent all cases. Depending if they have a preference(aka TROPISM) for tissue found specifically in the central nervous system  a number of viruses can potentially cause meningitis. Though it is impossible to eliminate all chances  you can reduce it with certain viruses that are transmitted by vectors like mosquitoes (West Nile  Eastern Equine Encephalitis  Dengue)  and by safe sex practices/abstinence (HIV  HSV). Well...meningitis is incredibly rare. The best way to prevent viral infections is frequent hand washing and hygiene. Unfortunately  unless you live in complete isolation in a sterile environment  you will get viral infections at some point.

3484	Q:8249A:844145	What is the difference between meningitis and encephalitis? Meningitis is inflammation or infection of the fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) and membranes (meninges) covering the brain and spinal cord. Encephalitis is inflammation or infection of the brain tissue itself. When the two diseases happen together  it is called meningoencephalitis. The meninges is a thick set of membranes that cover the brain.  There is fluid within these membranes that can become infected.  There may be some spread into vessels that go into the brain.  The encephalon is the brain cells.  If infection affects the meninges it is meningitis.  If the infection gets into brain cells  it is encephalitis.

3487	Q:1245A:23221	How do doctors diagnose Meningitis? Although  we often have a pretty good idea when examining a child  that they have meningitis  the only way to diagnose it is with a spinal tap. Xrays and blood tests are no help. Symptoms of meningitis typically include high fever  ill-appearing child  vomiting (usually without diarrhea)  neck pain/stiffness or alteration in mental status (eg. excessive lethargy). Some children may have a purplish rash on the body. The clinical signs may prompt further testing. The definitive study of choice is a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).

3500	Q:593768A:883698	Can you get meningitis from an ear infection? Ear infections  bacterial or viral could cause potentially cause meningitis. Basically any infection close to the brain could potentially spread to the meninges but again the chance are usually low. If you have any suspicion that you or someone close to you has meningitis  get them to a doctor ASAP. If the infecting agent is aggressive and the host (you) is vulnerable  the ear infection could spread to the meninges. This is usually through hematogenous spread (through the blood stream) rather than through neighboring invasion.  Rarely  if the infection is ignored  it can spread to the mastoid air sacs  thence to the venous sinuses in the brain  and thus cerebritis.

3502	Q:742658A:1108484	What vaccines do they use against meningitis for people ages 12+? Vaccines will protect most  but not all  kinds of meningococcal disease. In the United States  two vaccines that can prevent meningococcal disease are: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine which can be given to people age 2- 55 and Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine can be used when MCV4 is not available. It is the only licensed vaccine for people over 55. Both vaccines protect about 90% of patients. Immunization  MCV4  Meningitis  Meningococcal disease  Meningococcal vaccine  Vaccinations
3503	Q:1247A:517	Is there a vaccine for Bacterial Meningitis? Infants of 2 months or older receive Hib (hemophilus influenzae  type B) and pneumococcal vaccine to protect them from getting serious infections including meningitis caused by the two most common bacteria.  Meningitis in infants under 2 months of age is most often caused by group B 'strep' infection against which we do not have a vaccine. There are 3 major types of bacterial meningitis after the age of 2 months -- HiB  pneumococcal  and meningococcal.  There are effective vaccines for the major strains of all of them.  E. coli and Group B strep are responsible for most cases of meningitis under 2 months of age; there are no vaccines for them  yet  and treatment of certain maternal infections is key to lessen the risk of such illnes Meningitis  Pneumococcal vaccine  Hib  CSF culture  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Baby  Group B strep  Bacterial meningitis Meningitis  Bacterial meningitis  Hib  CSF culture  Group B strep  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Immunization Meningitis  Pneumococcal vaccine  Hib  CSF culture  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Baby  Group B strep  Bacterial meningitis Meningitis  Bacterial meningitis  Hib  CSF culture  Group B strep  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Immunization Meningitis  Pneumococcal vaccine  Hib  CSF culture  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Baby  Group B strep  Bacterial meningitis Meningitis  Bacterial meningitis  Hib  CSF culture  Group B strep  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Immunization Meningitis  Pneumococcal vaccine  Hib  CSF culture  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Baby  Group B strep  Bacterial meningitis Meningitis  Bacterial meningitis  Hib  CSF culture  Group B strep  Infection  Bacteria  Vaccinations  Immunization

3509	Q:21956A:75975	Is it possible to get meningitis in your joints? But it's possible for one of the bacteria that causes meningitis to infect a joint.  Meningitis is  by definition  an infection of the lining of the brain.  When it's in a joint and not in the brain  it's not meningitis.  If the infection is in the brain and a joint  then the infected person has meningitis AND a joint infection  probably from the same germ. A variety of infectious agents can travel in the blood and end up in both the brain and a joint However  if a germ known to cause meningitis is only found in the joint it is simply a joint infection.

3520	Q:11240A:153000	Can the meningitis vaccine contribute to autism of my child New studies in Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry  2011 & J Toxicol Environ Health A. 2011 did find a relationship between vaccines & autism The currently used vaccines for children in the United States are not related to autism. They do not cause autism  make autism better  nor make it worse. However  the 3 meningitis vaccines can contribute good to the health of an autistic child. The reason is that such a child already has one brain problem  so parents and doctors do not want such a child to suffer a brain infection like meningitis. No vaccine has been shown to cause autism. This has been studied exhaustively over the past decade. People became worried about vaccinating their children for whooping cough because of this mistaken idea  & now the US has more whooping cough cases since the 1950's!  The HIB vaccine has saved thousands of lives  almost eradicated haemophilus infections  is very safe  & very effective. There is no data zero nada    that any vaccine causes autism. And much scientific proof that they do not!! Someone earlier referenced the article from  J Toxicol Environ Health A. 2011 Jan;74(14):903-16. It doesn't show causality between vaccines and autism. The authors even state   Although individuals probably have a genetic predisposition to develop autism  researchers suspect that one or more environmental triggers are also needed.   The article associates vaccination rates with autism ONLY. Autism is a developmental condition which is currently diagnosed in about 1 in 150 children. Recent imagining studies show that the brains of children who later develop autism demonstrate changes in the first few months of life. The current thought is that it has a very strong genetic component. The study cited prior (J of Inorganic Biochemistry) uses a a logic algorithm (Hill's Criteria) to show a strong association- however  this is NOT CAUSATION. Hill's criteria doesn't even begin to take into consideration  the complex interplay between genetics and environmental factors that contribute to the diversity seen in autistic children. To conclude so  is dangerous to children we care for.

3537	Q:11232A:59208	I have herpes.  Am I at risk for viral meningitis? Theoretically viral meningitis is possible. But it usually occurs in immunosuppressed people  children and older age groups. Since herpes simplex virus is a cause of viral meningitis  a person with herpes is at some risk for viral meningitis. However  viral meningitis is not common  can be from other viruses  and some people who get herpes meningitis never had herpes sores before. So  a normal person with herpes should not worry too much about meningitis  since his risk is likely similar to the risk everyone else has.

3624	Q:742879A:1098812	Should i go to the pediatrician or hospital if i have some symptoms of meningitis? Meningitis is a potentially life threatening illness usually presenting with severe headache  and fevers. Some patients may have neck stiffness and inability to bend the neck. If you are well enough to write this  hopefully you are not having serious symptoms  but if you are considering meningitis  it&#x27;s time to go to the ER. If you think you have meningitis  then you should be evaluated immediately. Most physicians recommend an emergency room evaluation to see if you have bacterial or viral meningitis. If you have bacterial meningitis  then that is treated in the hospital with antibiotics. If you have a viral meningitis  then sometimes this can be treated as an outpatient depending on the type of virus you have.

3639	Q:109442A:950673	If I can calm someone and give BP pill to someone I think might be having a stroke  can they go to ER by car>? You never know what might happen minute to minute. They could pass out  seize  stop breathing  have an abnormal heart rhythm  or have a heart attack. Call 911 and go by ambulance. Stroke is an acute medical emergency with the potential for permanent disability.  Some patients are eligible for treatment with clot-disolving agents that can minimize the impact.  The most common reason why patients don't get this treatment is undue delay in reaching the emergency department.  Do not delay  do not go by car  call 911.  And immediately lowering BP can be dangerous in stroke. Most strokes coincide with high blood pressure but we should not lowered too quick too fast. As long as the pt arrives to the emergency room in less than 4.5 hours is ok so the Drs in the ER may give something to dissolve the clot causing the stroke. If we give aspirin we might worsen an intracraneal bleeding. If we lower the pressure the strokes gets worst. It's better to call 911 and just wait. If a stroke is suspected call 911.  The person is always seen quicker that way as strict protocols are in place. High blood pressure is not the only cause of stroke and I would not recommend giving anymore than the usual daily dose.

3640	Q:348709A:992703	Is it safe to get pregnant after having an avm rupture & hemoragric stroke in the brain? This is not an easy question. It is safe IF the AVM is completely obliterated and your blood pressure is well controlled. Additionally  if you are on an anti convulsant for seizure prophylaxis   you must confirm with your neurologist that it is safe for a fetus. Also  consider what physical disabilities you have particularly motor  these will be most impacted later in pregnancy. If the AVM has been obliterated and there is angiographic documentation that it is gone  then pregnancy should not lead to further bleeding from this source. If the AVM has not been obliterated  then it is known that pregnancy leads to increased cerebral blood volume and flow. This can increase the risk of rupture.

3659	Q:937691A:1329688	Can the eye have a stroke?  If so  what can happen to the vision? A stroke is a blockage of a blood vessel in the nervous system causing some degree of altered or damaged function.  The back of the eye has blood vessels that in certain circumstances be occluded causing a stroke  which produces loss of vision  in the area of the retina supplied by that vessel.  In extreme cases  the central artery is blocked and all vision is lost in that eye. Such an event is the result of a retinal artery occlusion and the result is loss of vision in the effected eye.

3665	Q:109771A:202137	Can someone explain this to me.--post stroke aphasia)? Aphasia is a disorder of language processing - it may take the form of poor comprehension (receptive aphasia) or inability to think of words (expressive aphasia). The latter is more common. The individual is frustrated as they know what they want to say but can't find the words. Sometimes they can use a keyboard or point to pictures to communicate but not always. Speech therapy and time can help. Aphasia after stroke occurs after the portion of the brain that controls language is injured from insufficient blood flow (often a clot).  Afterwards  patients appear attentive  and at times have the appearance of wanting to communicate  but are unable to either understand verbal or written language  or utter a sentence  or some combination of the two.  Prognosis often depends on initial severity Aphasia is an impairment of language or speech that can occur following any type of injury (trauma  tumor  stroke  infection) which involves one the speech areas of the brain.

Stroke from any cause  including AF  can occur in any severity from very mild to very severe.  A person who suddenly lost the ability to speak and is paralyzed in the right arm and leg would probably notice something is up. A person with a little haziness of thought for 20 minutes might not. The person with a stroke in evolution (TIA or CVA or bleed) may not recognize the situation and that's why AHA has encouraged knowledge of the signs.Similar stroke symptoms may be related to carotid disease  heart disease  atrial fibrillation and high blood pressure There are many causes for a stroke  which manifest as a sudden loss of neurological function in some part of the brain.  However  there are many causes: you could have a stroke from a clot that forms in the brain (ischemic stroke)  from a clot that moved from the heart (as in atrial fibrillation)  from a plaque in the neck (carotid artery disease). They'd all feel and look the same. Beyond a shadow of a doubt is a term that is seldom used in medicine.  As previously answered a stroke may come from multiple sources  including the heart.

In general  a stroke of the left frontal lobe can lead to speech loss  or expressive aphasia. There are many different types of speech disturbances which can occur following a stroke. Strokes of the temporal lobe can also lead to disordered speech and difficulty interpreting speech. A stroke that affects Broca's area in the dominant hemisphere will affect expressive speech and possibly comprehension. This can be due to ischemic stroke eg a plaque rupture and/or blood clot  hemorrhagic (bleeding) or embolic (drifting blood clot) types of stroke.

3714	Q:891070A:1270263	What routine care is given after a stroke occurs? If the stroke is caused by a vessel blockage and the patient is seen early enough  clot busters may be administered. If the stroke is from a bleed into the brain then there might be the need for surgery to remove the clot and reduce pressure on the brain. The blood pressure is controlled to be high enough to supply the brain but not too high to cause a bleed. Oxygen is always given.

3716	Q:171108A:1031105	What are some developments in the treatment of acute stroke? If a stroke patient can get to the emergency room within 4 hours  TPA can be given by vein in hopes of breaking up the clot blocking the brain artery.  If the patient gets there before 6 to 8 hours  we can place a catheter within the artery in the brain and frequently be able to break up the clot that way.  It is riskier  however. It is most important to seek treatment for sudden changes in the ability to move  sense  or think.  If a stroke is treated in first few hours  a great improvement in outcome may be possible.  If you wait even a few hours to see if if gets better  the chances of improved recovery are greatly lessened.

3717	Q:106886A:210001	Is dementia post stroke due to damage from the stoke or later vascular events/? Every stroke have different presentations. Some people have problems with speech and langauge. Some people have problems maintaining independency. If there is a facility that specialized post stroke rehabilitation center  I would order neuropsychological evaluation. The stroke itself may cause dementia  depending on the location in the brain.  Not all strokes cause significant cognitive impairment.  Also  the person who had the stroke is often at risk to have additional strokes and progressing cerebrovascular disease  related to the same risk factors that contributed to the initial stroke. Its important to remember that dementia is often caused by multiple processes and recent studies have shown that patients predisposed to Alzheimer's may have acceleration of that illness by other events  such as strokes. Vascular dementia is based on ongoing damage to the brain which may not be as dramatic as a stroke.  Likely there has been some asymptomatc damage even before the stroke.

3766	Q:10735A:141501	How likely will a stroke lead to death? That really depends on how severe the stroke is. If it affects things like your swallowing and you ability to walk so that you are confined to bed  that is much more serious. Most improvement occurs fairly early  so it is ususlly fairly easy to predict the long term outcome. It also depends on what other disease you have  that is how your health was prior to the strokel. Stroke is classified into many different subtypes. Some have a much higher mortality rate than others. As an example  patients with a ruptured aneurysm have a higher rate of death than those with a small ischemic stroke. Questions about individual stroke risk should be directed to your physician.

Speech pathologist will check each stroke patient using a test called a modified barium swallow. If the patient fails this test an ng tube may be needed. If swallowing does not improve a gastrosty tube may be needed long term. If the patient needs oral nutrition or oral medication & has trouble eating or swallowing  a nasogastric tube provides a relatively short term solution other than IVs or TPN.  Also  if there is any impairment of gastric motility in a stroke patient  this may alleviate discomfort.

And the rate of reocclusion..   Use of heparin further reduces the rate with t-PA and reteplase    (but no so clear for Streptokinase). I guess our best option is to see what emergency room physicians and neurologist have as a protocol in each center. If  CT of brain reveal no bleeding and if the pt. is in the window period ( less than 4.5 hours from symptoms )to receive fibrinolytics ( tPa or others) this is going to break the clot and restore the circulation avoiding serious neurological damage.Aspirin is started 24.

3774	Q:231617A:333373	What are the differences between a stroke and a heart attack? Atherosclerosis  an accumulation of white blood cells within the walls of arteries  is the primary basis for both events. But people have long focused not on the underlying process  but symptoms & the end organ affected. Brain is the least tolerant of blood flow interruption  heart  next least tolerant (in terms of severity of debility & threat to life) Yet the majority of events are asymptomatic. Most strokes are caused by obstruction of arteries by atherosclerotic plaques ( cholesterol plaques) and clots which is the same cause of the myocardial infarctions.Brain infarcts are strokes.

3775	Q:320041A:1241295	Can steroid injections ever cause a stroke? You're probably aware of the recent national news of a contaminated lot of compounded steroid that caused fungal meningitis in a small percentage of recipients. The symptoms for some of those affected were stroke symptoms. Otherwise  the answer is: no. This was unprecedented. if the vertebral artery is inadvertently punctured during cervical spine injection  a stroke could be the result. The steroids themselves do not cause stroke  but have unfortunately reviewed cases where injections were woefully misdirected and caused blood vessel and spinal cord damage with subsequent neurological issue.  In the hands of an expert  used judiciously  these are very safe and effective.  But not all docs are the same ethically  so  do your homework  and make sure you know who is the best. All procedures carry risk and should be thoughtfully employed.  There have been issues with contaminated steroid products and procedural errors can occur.

Could've damage to the part of the brain which controls your hand. Your neurologist can give detailed explanation. By definition a stroke is a loss of brain tissue which leads to loss of function of the body in the distribution of the body that brain tissue controls. While improvements in function can occur with healing of areas of the brain and due to brain plasticity  brain tissue does not replace itself.

3850	Q:74788A:122072	What are the symptoms of a stroke? Since the brain is the control center of the body the signs and symptoms of a stroke are many and may depend on what type of stoke it is and where in the brain it occurred.  But In general  patients may suddenly present with weakness or loss of sensation in limbs or face  difficulty speaking  abnormal vision fields or eye alignment  reduced senses  and difficulty with balance or walking. A stroke involves loss of blood supply to an area in the brain  from a blood clot or blockage in a blood vessel  or less often bleeding into the brain. Specific symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected  Some possible symptoms include  sudden weakness on one side of the body  sudden confusion or problem speaking  sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes  sudden severe head ache. STROKE is the name given to SUDDEN VASCULAR LESION usually reserved for brain or spinal cord The symptoms depends on the site sudden weakness of one side of the body to a facial droop  sudden visual loss  balance problem or speech disorder. There are too many presentations caused by blood vessel problems By definition  any vision changes that occur with stroke must show up in both eyes. Sometimes it is subtle  but because the nerves from your eyes cross over  any stroke will affect both.

3864	Q:13170A:113832	What is a   mini-stroke   or TIA? It is the sudden development of focal neurologic symptoms/signs which resolve in less than 24 hours. It is usually due to debris (like broken plaque)  platelets and/or thrombus that lodge in a brain vessel  obstructing circulation  but dissolving in < 1 day. Vascular spasm is often a component and it's resolution contributes to rapid improvement. A TIA or transient ischemic attack is what happens when the brain experiences a brief episode of ischemia  or when blood flow to an area of the brain is temporarily reduced or impeded. This results in neurological changes that typically  but not always resolve within 24 hours.  Unlike a true   stroke    a TIA has no lasting cell death or permanent neurological symptoms.

3866	Q:370968A:809824	What is a stroke? What are the causes of strokes and what are the signs? Most strokes are caused either by blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain.  About three quarters of strokes occur when a blood clot closes a blood vessel in the brain; most of the remainder is due to a blood vessel bursting and bleeding into the brain.Major risk factors for stroke include atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)  atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disorder)  hypertension  high cholesterol  diabetes  and smoking.  Family history of stroke also increases risk.Signs of stroke vary.  Common signs are sudden paralysis in one part of the body  such as an arm or leg  drooping of one side of the face  slurred speech  or difficulty speaking.  Headache and vertigo can be signs of stroke  but are much less common.  Sudden onset of   the worst headache of my life   is very worrisome for a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.If stroke symptoms occur  it's critical to take action quickly.  Stroke symptoms should be treated as a   brain attack    just as urgently as chest pain would be.  Call 911 or go to the closest emergency room without delay. Stroke is blockage of blood vessels causing secondary death of brain tissue.  This can occur due to local thrombosis or distal embolism.  The latter might be due to a clot from the heart  the former associated with hypertension  diabetes  high blood fats  homocysteine.  Could present with sudden focal weakness of arm and leg  loss of speech or vision  gait imbalance  etc. Angina  Artery  Atrial fibrillation  Bleeding  Blood  Blood clot  Body  Brain  Cerebral vascular accident  Cerebrum Aphasia  Arm  Asthenia  Blood  Blood clot  Brain  Cardiac  Cerebral vascular accident  Cerebrum  Diabetes
3867	Q:653490A:990543	What does stroke mean? I assume you mean cerebral stroke (brain). There are heat strokes  etc. Brain stroke refers to a rapid loss of brain function. This can be due to loss of blood supply to the brain tissue or a brain bleed (hemorrhage). A transient loss of blood supply whereby the brain function is immediately restored when the blood supply is restored is called a mini stroke  ie    transient ischemic attack   2 kinds of stroke: ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic (either thrombotic or embolic) is like a clogged drain in your house. Hemorrhagic is like a burst pipe. In either case  you don't get water flowing where you need it. Same w/stroke - you lose blood flow to vital areas in your brain (are there non-vital areas?). Without blood flow  brain dies. So if you think you're having a stroke  call 911.

However  Clinical coorelation is recommended An EEG is somewhat crude and imprecise  and does not demonstrate well many small and focalized lesions.  Better to do MRI and provide direct visual signs of dysfunction. A large stroke that involves the outer layer of the brain (cortex) can cause enough depression of the electrical activity that this will be detectable on an EEG.

The risk of all of the above is reduced with good blood pressure control  avoidance of atherosclerosis  and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Although difficult because it requires lifestyle changes  these changes and close monitoring of blood pressure  diabetes  cholesterol can yield a profound effect in reducing your risk for future stroke.  Some surgical procedures are available to open up arteries that have plaque that may increase the risk of stroke.  Being vigilant and proactive and seeing a stroke specialist who create a plan. See stroke.org for risk factors and treatment. All of the above are preventable by routine measures such as good blood pressure control  proper diet  exercise and blood sugar control.

3903	Q:482185A:816569	What is the definition or description of: Heat stroke? Heat stroke is the most severe manifestation of heat-related illness. It is defined as a body temperature of greater than 40.6 ∞C (105.1 ∞F) due to heat exposure with lack of thermoregulation. Symptoms may include dry skin; rapid  strong pulse; and dizziness. Heat stroke occurs in a hot environment where the individual has become extremely dehydrated.  At some point the body starts to conserve water rather than sweat and virtually all natural cooling stops.  The body starts to increase body temperatures above 106.  It is fatal without intervention.  It is a true medical emergency.

3924	Q:277439A:396341	how do I prevent another stroke? If you have already had a stroke and are relatively young  you need a work-up to look for the cause of the stroke. There are entities more prevalent in the young (aneurysms  arteriovenous malformations) that can lead to stroke-like symptoms.  If no etiology is found  then you use stroke prevention measures like controlling BP  diabetes  lipids  smoking. A stroke neurologist is very helpful. You are rather young for a stroke  and prevention may depend on why the first occurred.  Make sure that all risk factors  such as hypertension  diabetes  high cholesterol  high triglycerides  and primary heart problems are controlled.  Meds for abnormal heart rhythms  and anti-platelet preps may be useful.  Rarely  patients who have migraine  take BCP's  and smoke experience stroke.

3934	Q:35034A:190300	Why would you use oxygen therapy in stroke? Oxygen therapy is supposed to increase the oxygen content in the blood as there is lack of oxygen delivery to the brain by an occluded vessel. The lack of oxygen delivered results in neurons' death - stroke. Oxygen therapy specifically to treat a stroke is not effective. The only reason to use oxygen therapy in the setting of a stroke is for a person with underlying lung or heart disease who is not absorbing enough oxygen in their blood. We can detect this with a device called a pulse oximeter.

3956	Q:626099A:938614	What is brain stroke? The term stroke usually refers to either a blockage to an artery to the brain  leading to damage of brain tissue from lack of oxygenated blood (ischemic stroke)  or it can refer to a bleed from a blood vessel within the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).  Both are life threatening conditions  and the prognosis depends on the size and location of the stroke. A stroke is dead brain cells due to lack of oxygen supply to the brain.  It can be cause either due to a blockage of blood supply or excessive bleeding into the brain.   Once the brain cells start to die  deficits occur like memory loss or loss of function of motor function. a common term for the phenomenon caused by occluding an artery feeding the brain. The symptoms are caused by lack of blood supply to a region of the brain  so the region doesn't function. The lfet middlecerebral artery feeds the cortex that controls the muscles on the right side  and speech  so one may not be able to speak the right words (aphasia) and the arm and leg weak/flaccid on right. It is an area of dead tissue in brain that is caused by lack of blood and oxygen.

If someone is having an ischemic stroke  ambulance is the best way to go to the ER.  Driving yourself is not advisable.  Paramedics can institute appropriate measures   in the field   such as starting an IV  directing you to a primary stroke center  administering oxygen  checking serum glucose level  etc. There is always a possibility of getting worse. Time is Brain.  The quicker someone gets to a hospital where stroke care is available  the better the result. If private transportation would be significantly quicker in doing this  then do it. But paramedics have medications on board and are in direct communication with the receiving hospital's doctors  so that they can monitor and respond to patient needs en route.

3999	Q:505330A:861171	can essure give u blood clotd and a stroke? Essure is a method of permanent birth control that introduces coils into your tubes that over the next few months cause the tubes to scar down and block so pregnancy cannot occur. There are no hormones. You will need a test after a few months to show the tubes are blocked. For the test xray dye is introduced into the uterus to confirm tube blockage. Until then some other birth control is needed. Essure  permanent   plugs   in your tube doesn't effect anything other than preventing sperm from reaching your eggs.  So it doesn't cause blood clots in veins  strokes  mood changes  etc. that may occur with birth control pills. It's the most effective method of permanent birth control and can be performed in a gynecologist's office in about 10 minutes.

4028	Q:12682A:82545	Is it possible to have no symptoms and then just have the stroke out of the blue from it? Although commonly there are warning signs called TIA's prior to the stroke  it can  like a heart attack  just come on suddenly and without any warning at all. Many folks who have a stroke say they had no warnings prior to the stroke. When family history was reviewed and warnings of stroke risk or impending stroke described a good number of those folks were able to identify them in family and themselves. What that means is knowing family history and stroke warning signs can help prevent strokes or early stroke intervention and treatment. Many folks who have strokes say they had no warnings yet when family history is reviewed and warning signs discussed a large number of them are able to recall things that qualify as warnings.

Carotid artery aneurysm is rare but cause emboli or clot to brain and stroke Yes.  An aneurysm can cause a stroke.  There are two ways to have a stroke.  A hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding) or ischemic stroke (blockage).   The bigger concern with aneurysms is a hemorrhage  especially with intracranial (in the brain) aneurysms.  If the aneurysm ruptures  there is bleeding in the brain and brain tissues are damaged.  Aneurysms can also form clots due to low flow. A ruptured aneurysm produces a subarachnoid hemorrhage  which can create local vasospasm and decreased blood flow to areas of brain and resultant stroke.

4051	Q:190596A:275329	What age can u have a heart attack or stroke? It all depends on your risk factors and other medical history as well as family history in some cases.  Generally  though  it starts in the 30s - at least currently. Though considered rare  coronary occlusion is a complication of Kawasaki disease in children and strokes do occur in infants or toddlers that have vascular malformations. Premi infants also may have intra-cranial hemorrhages during the intensive efforts to keep them alive.The adult cases are more frequent & expected  but this completes the spectrum. Both heart attacks and strokes can occur at any age  from many different causes. Both involve disrupting the blood flow to the heart muscle and brain tissue  which can be caused by things like blood clots  medications/drugs  spasm of blood vessels or even air in the bloodstream.

4052	Q:193111A:287480	If I have a blood clot in my leg  is it possible for a stroke? A blood clot in the leg is typically in a vein and if it dislodges it may go to the heart. Most of the time it will pass through the heart and go to the lung. This is known as a pulmonary embolus. In some people it may pass through one side of the heart to the other and then go into the arterial blood system  even to the brain where it may cause a stroke. Deep venous thrombosis is a clot in a leg vein. Strokes are causes by a blockage of an artery going to the brain. Usually the two are not related  but a condition making blood clot abnormally (hypercoagulable state) could lead to both problems. Smoking  obesity  high cholesterol  etc also negatively affect the cardiovascular system. Either you can have hypercoag unable status which means u form clots more than usual or in some patients with a condition called PFO/ patent foramen ovale where right and left heart chambers/ the atriums can connect directly and clots from leg can travel through veins from right to left side of heart and can cause a stroke in a condition called paradoxical embolism Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Lung  Leg  Blood  Blood clot  Embolus  Travel  Patent foramen ovale Smoking  Cholesterol test  Cardiovascular  Leg  Vascular system  Artery  Blood  Blood clot  Dyslipidemia  Brain Travel  Patent foramen ovale  Veins  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Leg  Foramen ovale  Blood  Blood clot  Cerebral vascular accident Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Lung  Leg  Blood  Blood clot  Embolus  Travel  Patent foramen ovale Smoking  Cholesterol test  Cardiovascular  Leg  Vascular system  Artery  Blood  Blood clot  Dyslipidemia  Brain Travel  Patent foramen ovale  Veins  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Leg  Foramen ovale  Blood  Blood clot  Cerebral vascular accident Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Lung  Leg  Blood  Blood clot  Embolus  Travel  Patent foramen ovale Smoking  Cholesterol test  Cardiovascular  Leg  Vascular system  Artery  Blood  Blood clot  Dyslipidemia  Brain Travel  Patent foramen ovale  Veins  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Leg  Foramen ovale  Blood  Blood clot  Cerebral vascular accident Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Lung  Leg  Blood  Blood clot  Embolus  Travel  Patent foramen ovale Smoking  Cholesterol test  Cardiovascular  Leg  Vascular system  Artery  Blood  Blood clot  Dyslipidemia  Brain Travel  Patent foramen ovale  Veins  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Leg  Foramen ovale  Blood  Blood clot  Cerebral vascular accident

4063	Q:175047A:950653	How and where is stroke treated? Strokes are either due to hemorrhage or due to vascular occlusion (ischemic).   In all strokes careful BP control (avoiding too fast a drop in BP to avoid  hypoperfusion secondary to cerebral auto regulation influences) is needed.  Ischemic strokes might benefit by thrombolysis if confronted early  as well as antiplatelet meds (aspirin  plavix).  Longterm risk is reduced with lipid-lowering meds An acute stroke is treated in an ER and then a hospital.  Depending on the deficits that result from the stroke  a patient who had a stroke may need to do various types of rehab  such as physical  occupational or speech therapy. If the needs are severe these may be done in a rehab facility. Other times it's done as an outpatient. Don't forget the importance of preventing a 2nd stroke! A suspected stroke is a medical emergency.  Person or family should call 911 as time is very important for treatment.  If the stroke is caused by a blocked artery treatment to break the blockage is available.  After the stroke is stable and the treatment is complete rehabilitation can start.

4080	Q:77080A:127444	What happens after a person has a stroke and she is in the hospital in the icu? A stroke (CVA) is due to a vascular occlusion in the brain.  The part affected will cease to function or will function poorly. Recovery depends upon how rapidly circulation is restored and also the disappearance of edema.  ICU treatment is to compensate for poor breathing or other functions requiring continuous care.  Release to a regular room is when any crisis is over. First  the decision is made whether the person is a candidate for clot-busting medicine via serial physical exams  brain CT scans  etc.  usually in the ER. Once in the ICU  vital signs  especially BP  are stabilized. Depending on the size of the stroke  the patient may need ventilator support  at least temporarily.

The majority of strokes occur in people with risk factors: high blood pressure (that&#x27;s the biggest one)  carotid arteriosclerosis (don&#x27;t smoke  check your cholesterol)  and atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm problem - the risk  is mainly for people with diabetes or are &gt;age 65  especially &gt;75). You&#x27;re only 32. Did anyone in your family have a stroke? young? did they have risk factors you don&#x27;t? At the age of 32 and with no significant medical conditions the risk of stroke is extremely low. If you have medical conditions that could lead to stroke then seek medical treatment. If it is a &quot;fear&quot; of a stroke only then would recommend psychological counseling to help here. Read up on risks  then check risks (no nicotine  check blood pressure  keep yourself hydrated)  have your doc get a lipid profile  carotid ultrasound  start the &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot;.

4097	Q:264496A:380332	how do I treat a possible heat stroke at home? Heat stroke is a life threatening emergency. It should never be treated at home due to the complexity of the problems which can come from heat stroke.  Heat exhaustion may be treated carefully at home but better if treated under the care of a Dr.  Hydration  rest  cooling  no exposure to heat for days  good nutrition will all help.  See your family MD immediately if you think heat stroke. A true 'heat stroke' is a medical emergency and can be extemely dangerous if not evaluated and treated by medical providers.  'Heat exhaustion' is more common and not quite as dangerous  but this is not a diagnosis to make on your own - if you underestimate how bad the situation is  and your body temperature shoots up due to the 'heat stroke'  you will basically COOK YOUR BRAIN.

4099	Q:226200A:388420	How to treat hyperthermia or heat stroke? Hyperthermia can first be treated with hydration and cool compresses and getting the person out of the heat. Heat stroke is when the body can no longer release the heat by perspiring  so the skin will be red and dry. this is a true medical emergency and needs to get help in a hospital. Always check on the elderly during very hot weather. Best treatment is prevention. Pre-hydrate before heat exposure and continuing to hydrate  wear loose clothing and take breaks. Once heat stroke occurs  IV fluids  which may themselves be cooled are used in addition to external cooling.

4100	Q:18408A:71099	Can you have a stroke from hypothyroidism? The only possible connection I can see would be if your cholesterol/triglycerides were so high due to low thyroid that arteries to your brain got clogged up or that your blood pressure got so low from associated endocrine problems (such as adrenal insufficiency often accompanying severe thyroid problems) that your brain lacked adequate blood flow. Hypothyroidism  if treated properly  shouldn't cause any problems.  If you suspect hypothyroidism  see your PCP.  If you have it  take your medicines as prescribed and keep routine follow up appointments for follow up lab work.  Stroke is basically not problem with this disease  and would only be possible in severe and untreated hypothyroidism.  Best Wishes.

4102	Q:22988A:85360	What should be the role of antiplatelet therapy in stroke? Aspirin therapy can decrease chance of stroke in patients with carotid artery disease. If patient has experienced a TIA or mini stroke  Plavix may be added. If patient has a stroke these medicines will be used a day or two after the stroke to prevent more strokes. Better not to use the day of a stroke due to risk of bleeding  unless special circumstances. Antiplatelet therapy is indicated for secondary stroke prevention in both large and small vessel disease. This would include carotid artery  vertebrobasilar arteries  and the intracranial arteries. Current recommendations are for single agent therapy  but patients should be tested periodically with platelet aggregation tests to determine drug efficacy.

4103	Q:35031A:67168	When should stroke rehabilitation start? Stroke rehabilitation should start as soon as the person is medically stable and able to work with the therapists.  Medically stable would be when the person is out of the intensive care unit of a hospital.   Able to work with the therapists is when the person has the energy and desire to work with the therapists.  This may be either when in the hospital or as an outpatient. As soon as medically/neurologically stable an active rehab program should begin. In fact some basic therapy  evaluations and activity should be initiated if medically appropriate in the acute care hospital even before the patient is transferred to a more active rehab program.This could include acute hospital level rehab  subacute rehab  home rehab and an outpatient program Stroke rehab should start immediately after it's been diagnosed. Simple in bed movements is considered part of mobilization physical therapy.

4107	Q:10730A:406299	is there a large genetic component to stroke risk? The risks for most forms of stroke are similar to those for heart disease. The risk is increased with high blood pressure  hyperlipidemia ( too much fat in the blood). These problems have a genetic component but also large life style factors as well. Some risk factors such as smoking are 100% behavior related. Most of the risk is modifiable with healthy behaviors  diet  exercise  dont  smoke. Some types of stroke are definitely genetically determined such as Factor V Leiden deficiency.

4112	Q:713483A:1064946	What is the difference between a stroke and a seizure? A stroke occurs when there is an interruption of blood flow to a part of the brain  either because of a blood clot or because of a ruptured blood vessel. This can lead to permanent damage  as the brain is no longer getting oxygen to that part. A seizure  however  is a greatly increased amount of electrical activity in the brain  and can manifest in a number of ways. A seizure is a sudden electrical surge in the brain usually related to brain malformation or dysplasia. Seizures can also be related to tumors or metastasis in the brain. Damage to brain by trauma  ischemia  and metabolic disorders can also result in seizure. Stroke is usually from blood vessel clot or narrowing due to atherosclerosis  high blood pressure  and hemorrhage from aneurysm.

4113	Q:95797A:162331	What is the type of stroke caused by hypertension and diabetes? There are 3 major kinds of stroke: ischemic  hemorrhagic  and embolic. Stroke and diabetes tend to cause the ischemic type - meaning hardening of the arteries and clot formation leading to abrupt blockage in an artery with loss of circulation beyond the blockage and death of the brain tissue served by that artery. Ischemic or hemorrhagic. Most of the diabetic related strokes are  ischaemic due to disease in the arteries & ultimate closure &  brain infarction.However with hypertension haemorrhage s can also occur & sometimes an ischaemic infarct can bleed & become haemorrhagic.Often clinical features can distinguish between the two but MRI/MRA will provide the final diagnosis Diabetes  Hardening of the arteries  Brain  Artery  Circulation  Tissue  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident Diabetes  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident  High blood pressure  Stroke  Hypertension  Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes  Bleeding  Brain  MRI scan  Infarction  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident  High blood pressure Diabetes  Hardening of the arteries  Brain  Artery  Circulation  Tissue  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident Diabetes  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident  High blood pressure  Stroke  Hypertension  Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes  Bleeding  Brain  MRI scan  Infarction  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident  High blood pressure Diabetes  Hardening of the arteries  Brain  Artery  Circulation  Tissue  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident Diabetes  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident  High blood pressure  Stroke  Hypertension  Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes  Bleeding  Brain  MRI scan  Infarction  Diabetes risks  Child Diabetes  Cerebral apoplexy  Cerebral vascular accident  High blood pressure

4118	Q:226631A:388441	Should you take warfarin or aspirin  if you have had a previous stroke? Depends on what type of stroke you had. If it was ischemic(form hardening of the arteries) then aspirin is generally recomended. If it is embolic( from a clot traveling to the brain  sy form Atrial fibrillation)  then warfarin is recomended. If you have had a cerebral embolism  you should be taking warfarin. If you have had an ischemic stroke  then you need an antiplatelet drug  of which aspirin is the best initial choice and should be continued until a stroke recurrence  if any  develops. Then aspirin could be replaced or supplemented by another antiplatelet drug.

4120	Q:12688A:407595	What is carotid artery stenosis and stroke? stroke.org and sirweb.org under stroke for good info. Carotid artery disease means that the carotid arteries have blockage  usually in the form of atherosclerosis.  This can cause stroke.  The more severe the blockage  the greater the riskIn the absence of neurological symptoms  most cases can be handled with medicine and close periodic follow up by a Vascular Surgeon. However  if the blockage is more than 80%  surgery will reduce the risk of stroke Your carotid arteries deliver blood to your brain and head. Carotid artery stenosis is when gunk and inflammation make it harder for the blood to flow. When your brain doesn't get enough blood  parts of your brain can die. That's a stroke. The good news? You can prevent this by: eating right  moving 30-60 minutes every day  controlling your blood pressure  not smoking. Thanks for asking. Carotid artery stenosis means narrowing of the artery. Stroke is death or damage to brain due to circulatory issues. Many strokes (approx 1/3rd) are due to carotid artery disease. Although frequently connected  they are not the same. Many strokes occur without carotid stenosis. Many carotids are completely occluded (slowly) without resultant strokes.

4130	Q:22985A:1123075	How can you tell if its an aneurysm  stroke and embolism? Although there may be some historical and clinical findings that can help distinguish these  in industrialized societies the gold standard would be imaging  probably with MRI.   Stroke   is a very broad term that can encompass embolism  intracranial bleeding  and atherosclerotic disease of the brain; either embolism or aneurysm could cause a type of   stroke  . Only imaging with cat scan or mri will give this information. Special scans called cta and mra show the vessels. If the answer is not clear  the patient may need arteriography. Stroke is technically a catch-all phrase for bleeding or lack of blood flow to a brain area from a blocked artery.  An aneurysm usually causes bleeding. A computed tomography scan (CT or CAT scan) is the quickest way to show bleeding into or around the brain. It can show vessel blockage and lack of blood flow if the affected area is large enough  if questions remain a MRI scan can show more.

4150	Q:76458A:266845	should I get ablation for my atrial fibrillation and is the robot the right way to go? That is the trend these days  but your cardiologist is the best one to answer this. Ablation is useful for those who are symptomatic despite a trial of medication. Robotic ablation may help reduce radiation exposure and achieve better ablation results if done by an experienced operator. The most common reason to pursue AF ablation is ineffective or poorly tolerated medical treatment.  I don't think it matters whether it is done robotically or not.  What is most important is the expertise of the physicians and ablation Center. The robot for atrial fibrillation will probably not improve the outcomes of the ablation.  It may make the procedure slightly faster  or perhaps less xray use - but the outcomes are about the same as the non-robot ablation.

4152	Q:103755A:165689	If you are in cardiac arrest  is your heart motionless or quivering? Strictly speaking cardiac arrest means no electrical activity in the heart or what is called asystole.  However  effective pumping of the heart also ceases in ventricular fibrillation where the heart would be quivering  but unable to pump blood. During cardiac arrest  the heart is not beating effectively to deliver blood to the tissues. It could be quivering if the heart is in ventricular fibrillation rhythmn or it could be completely still if the rhythmn is asystole. Either way  the person would have no pulse. A heart monitor is needed to tell the difference. Cardiac arrest just means the heart is not functioning effectively as a pump. Sometimes there is chaotic electrical activity causing it to   quiver   this is ventricular fibrillation. There are other situations in which the heart is motionless  perhaps without any electrical activity at all ( asystole) or with activity bit no contractions ( Pulseless electrical activity) Heart attack  Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Cardiac Heart attack  Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Cardiac Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Contraction  Fibrillation  Heart attack  Cardiac Heart attack  Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Cardiac Heart attack  Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Cardiac Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Contraction  Fibrillation  Heart attack  Cardiac Heart attack  Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Cardiac Heart attack  Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Cardiac Ventricular fibrillation  Cardiac arrest  Heart  Contraction  Fibrillation  Heart attack  Cardiac
4153	Q:40686A:35037	What is an electrical shock delivered to the heart to correct abnormal heart rhythms called? If it's a potentially fatal heart rhythm (eg ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation)  it's called defibrillation. In this case  a large amount of energy is delivered directly to the heart to stop it so that the internal pacemaker can re-activate it to a (hopefully) normal rhythm. In all cases  CPR (chest compressions) are required as well. If non-fatal (like atrial fibrillation)  it's cardioversion in which a lower energy & specific electrical phase is given with the patient sedated but awake so that the rhythm can be converted to the normal  sinus rhythm. An implantable AICD has cardioversion and defibrillation capabilities.  However  usually  it delivers a defibrillatory shock when it detects a dangerous rhythm.  Of course  the energy is much lower since less tissue needs to be penetrated (the electrical lead goes directly into the heart).

4154	Q:523886A:790010	If I had atrial Fibrillation  wouldn't the 30 day event monitor I wore have showed it? Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can occur with virtually any frequency. If the frequency is daily or weekly  the 30 day monitor is likely to catch it. If the frequency is less than every two weeks  then the chances of missing on a single one month recorder are pretty good. It depends if you have permanent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  If you did not have an episode during those 30 days  I will not show.  Paroxysmal means that is intermittent. Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation

4156	Q:143382A:221191	What are the primary indicators for implantable defibrillator? When the risk for cardiac arrest is high enough  a physician may recommend a patient get an ICD. This might be for patients with a weak heart  genetic disease (like HOCM  long QT  ARVD)  or someone who has survived a cardiac arrest already.

4157	Q:174061A:503120	What is the indication for surgical ablation (av node ablation) for atrial fibrillation? To control the ventricular response rate (pulse rate) to the atrial fibrillation when all other medications have failed  contraindicated  or are not tolerated due to unacceptable side effects. Cather ablation of the AV node is reserved for patients who can not get the pulse rate under control by any other method - it is usually only used as a last resort.  Before this  medications are tried  and usually some sort of catheter ablation for atrial fib specifically (not just the AV node).  A pacemaker is required prior to AV node ablation. Patients with atrial fibrillation and have difficulty controlling their rate can be treated with an AV node ablation which is a procedure that damages the AV node so that it won't conduct the beat.  This results in complete heart block and is treated with a pacemaker.  More recent treatments for AF include an AF ablation which gets rid of the AF directly and does not require a pacemaker. We don't generally do this with surgery  but rather with a   catheter   based procedure (wire we thread into the heart that cauterizes the AV node).  This procedure provides complete control of the heart rate in the lower chamber and excellent symptom control  but makes people dependent on the pacemaker that *must* be implanted with this procedure.

4160	Q:42143A:67409	How do class 1b antiarrhythmic drugs help in treating ventricular fibrillation? Class IB drugs work by blocking the rapid influx of sodium ions during the depolarization phase of the heartís depolarization-repolarization cycle. This decreases the refractory period  which reduces the risk of arrhythmia. These are weak drugs that do not improve survival and are used only to treat symptoms if at all. They're rarely used in modern treatment. Sodium channels are responsible for the action potential  the depolarization of the heart.  These drugs decrease the excitability of the heart because they interfere with the sodium channels.  So it will help against ventricular fibrillation.

I saw a doctor accidentally get shocked during a code. He didn't take his hand off the bed. He collapsed suddenly but recovered in a couple of seconds. Defibrillation works by stopping all electrical activity in the heart. This allows the heart to reset. We depend on the natural tendency of the heart to beat to restart it.

4164	Q:185398A:269873	Ventricular fibrillation fatal? Almost always.  It may terminate on it's own in some circumstances  but not very often.  If you had a internal or external defibrillator  then you could terminate the VF before it was fatal. In ventricular fibrillation  Vfib  the heart is quivering and there is no blood flow so the person is clinically dead. If the heart cannot be restored to a rhythmn where there is blood flow  the patient will then be pronounced dead. Treatment for this rhythmn includes electrically shocking the heart as quickly as possible. Performing CPR in the meantime can be life-saving.

4165	Q:344404A:499006	At what point do you seek immediate medical attention with what my doctor suggest are mitral valve prolapse symptoms that are persisting and worsening? MVP doesn't cause symptoms and is never an emergency.  Many symptoms are attributed to MVP but research has not confirmed any relationship. MVP is a variant of normal. In rare instances  a tiny subset of people with MVP will rupture an attachment of the valve and develop sudden severe leakage which causes immediate heart failure. If you had this  you wouldn't be at your computer! prolapse that causes any decrease in ejection fraction  symptoms of shortness of breath or decreased exercise tolerance are usually from the valve not just being   floppy    but actually leaking. This can also lead to atrial and ventricular enlargement or atrial fibrillation. All are indications for surgery. The best option for longterm survival is valve repair by an experienced surgeon.

4166	Q:17039A:98736	What is the left ventricular assist device? It is a device that assist the LV. It does so by relieving   work   or stress on the LV. The principle is for the blood going to the LV be diverted to a   pump   which then functions as a substitute LV to pump the blood back to circulate. Your natural LV then gets a rest as a substitute pump is doing the   work  . The pump can be in or outside your body. Instead of a totally artificial heart which replaces the entire heart  an LVAD is a much smaller pump that boosts the pumping ability of the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber). This has many technical advantages over a totally artificial heart. Blood  Body  Stress  Ventricular assist device Heart  Ventricle  Artificial heart  LVAD  Ventricular assist device
4167	Q:874795A:1277762	My heart has this weird beat to it; could it be atrial fibrillation? To know what your heart rhythm is you need an ecg and perhaps a holter monitor if nothing is present on the ecg. This can show your abnormal rhythm and identify it. At your age  atrial fib would be a bit unlikely  but yes  it could certainly be a culprit.

4168	Q:16565A:67510	What are the differences between asynchronous and synchronous cardioversion? All cardioversions should be synchronous which means that the delivered electrical impulse is timed to precisely coincide with the instant of electrical activation in the heart as indicated by the QRS complex on the cardiac monitor. Failure to do this can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Defibrillation is asynchronous because there is no QRS and the patient already has VF. Synchronous is when the shock is delivered on the QRS portion of the heart cycle - it is when the heart depolarises.  Asynchronous cardioversion can occur anywhere on the heart cycle.

4174	Q:16379A:266625	Which treatments control atrial fibrillation? There are medications to keep the heart in a normal rhythm after a shock to restore the normal rhythm. It is also possible just to leave the patient in fibrillation and give medication to prevent the heart from beating too rapidly. Either way  anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin or dabigatran might be needed to prevent clots depending on how many risk fractors are present. If not many  aspirin. The most important treatment is stroke prevention  which is usually done by medications (aspirin or warfarin).  Sometimes rate control medications are used  like metoprolol.  If the AF is severe enough  stronger anti-arrhythmic medications are used  like propafenone.  If these do not work  catheter ablation may be recommended.

4175	Q:370600A:813892	What's a shock to the heart called? When someone delivers a shock to the heart to treat abnormal rhythms  what's that called? There are two types of shocks  where electrical energy is delivered to the heart to restore a normal heart rhythm. When somebody experiences cardiac arrest  the shock is called a defibrillation. This can be delivered by an external defibrillator applied by medical personnel or by a bystander. Many common areas such as airports and malls now have Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) that can be applied by a layperson  and have been shown in research studies to increase the chances of survival after cardiac arrest. Some people at risk for cardiac arrest have defibrillators implanted in their body capable of recognizing abnormal rhythms and automatically delivering a shock.The other type of shock is called a synchronized cardioversion. This is performed when the heart is in an abnormal rhythm  but is still functioning fairly well and so is typically not performed in an emergency situation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common rhythm that requires cardioversion. This is a very safe and common procedure. A shock used for cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation)  is called defibrillation. All other shocks are called synchronized (direct current) cardioversions.

4183	Q:85222A:139365	My doctor told me yesterday that I have SVT. Is this dangerous? My last stress test was 3 years ago. Do I need a †cardiologist †appt.? Hello SVT (Supra-ventricular tachycardia) is a broad term that covers many different kinds of fast heart rates originating from the top of the heart. It could be caused by a fast sinus node  conduction loop  atrial fibrillation... It is usually not very dangerous but the treatment for each is different. You should see someone fairly soon to identify the kind of SVT and possible cure it. It depends on whether you have seen a cardiologist in the past and if there are new symptoms.   If you had a cardiology consult when you had your stress test and were diagnosed with SVT then they may not want to see you again unless changes develop. If you have actually been diagnosed with SVT by your primary doctor then you at least need to see a cardiologist to see if there is some other important underlying cause. In any case  further testing should be performed. Uncontrolled SVT can be quite dangerous if you have actual coronary or heart disease to begin with that is underlying and undiagnosed. Supreventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a fast heart rate that starts in the pace-maker of the heart. It can have a number of causes and can be dangerous if it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. You should go back to your doc and discuss this further and see if they want you to see a cardiologist. This will depend on your history and current symptoms.

4185	Q:119255A:184436	What is difference between cardioversion and defibrillation? Cardioversion means using a stimulus to change the heart's beat from an abnormal rhythm to a normal one.  Certain drugs can be used  or electricity  usually only a low voltage is required unless the abnormal rhythm is a very dangerous one called ventricular fibrillation.  When the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation  usually more voltage (electricity) is needed  and it is called defibrillation. Cardioversion  Ventricular fibrillation  Fibrillation  Rhythm

Perhaps there is something of greater concern (to your cardilologist) on your cardiac studies.  However  If your echo is unremarkable   and your holter exam shows PACs and PVCs without ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation  then obtaining a second opinion is reasonable before initiating an anti-arrhythmic med. I'd recommend discussing the treatment with your EP and ask the question you did here.

4192	Q:181713A:517144	What causes clots in patients with atrial fibrillation? The rapid rhythm in the upper chamber (atrium) cause a stagnation of blood flow through it - it beats too fast to force the blood through it efficiently.  Because of this  the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the area where >90% of the clots form in AF. Clots in the LAA break off and flow out of the heart and can cause a stroke. Anticoagulation - blood thing medications - reduce this risk. The extremely rapid rates of atrial fibrillation are in fact so fast that they create two problems: the top chamber is not mechanically moving very far at all  so it cannot shake clots loose  and the overactive atrial tissue secretes chemicals which increase the likelihood of clot formation.  These processes come together to substantially increase stroke risk.

There is a new attachment to iPhone that looks like a case and can show your rhythm   needs to be prescribed and interpreted by a doctor   though. Electrical activity during afib needs to be recorded for official diagnosis. Standard ECG  or longer tests such as holter monitor (24-48 hrs)  Zio patch (14 days)  event recorder/MCAT (up to 30days) or even an implantable loop recorded (3+ years).

4198	Q:566766A:851559	Could you tell me  if person has atrial fibrillation  is taking metoprolol   valium as needed .Also now require second medication for high blood pressure which one can go with valium  above. Most antihypertensives may be used.  However  my first choice is to adjust the dose of Metoprolol.  Rate control is more important than rhythm control with Atrial Fibrillation.  Thus  Metoprolol should be adjusted to maintain the heart rate at 65-75 beats per minute.  Another medication to consider is Dilantin.   Dilantin is very safe  and is an effective anti-arrhythmic.

4201	Q:45097A:40438	How does Quinidine  Procainamide  and Disopyramide treat atrial fibrillation? These medications  known as class I antiarrhythmics   work by blocking sodium channel conduction in the heart. This causes cardiac excitation to progress more slowly  hopefully preventing the formation of the driving force behind atrial fibrillation. These medications are older antiarrythmics that have been around for decades and may suppress AF. They must be used very cautiously and only by very experienced cardiologists  due to their potential to actually cause potentailly life threatening ventricular arrythmias in certain patients - called a pro-arrthymic effect..Newer medications have been shown to be both safer and more effective.

4202	Q:370579A:808458	Difference between paroxysmal arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation? Difference between paroxysmal arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation?  I'm trying to understand the difference between the two.  Can someone help me? Arrhythmia is a generic term for any abnormal heart rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is a specific type of arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular  fast heart rhythm caused by chaotic electrical activity in the atria  which are the upper chambers of the heart. Paroxysmal is a term used to describe arrhythmias that come and go suddenly. Atrial fibrillation is frequently paroxysmal  but can be chronic and more sustained (i.e. always present  as opposed to coming and going). There are other examples of paroxysmal arrhythmias  so it is important to distinguish between them because the treatment and prognosis can be quite different. A paroxysmal arrhythmia is one that is not present constantly. There are several abnormal rhythms that can be paroxysmal including atrial fibrillation. Alternatively atrial fibrillation can be present continuously  in which case it is not paroxysmal.

4203	Q:535259A:991443	I think I have atrial fibrillation. What should I do? Atrial fibrillation is the most common irregular rhythm of the heart. In some peiple they are alway in afib  but others go in and out.  It can increase your risk of strokes and many times you are put on a blood thinner to prevent them.  There is treatment for atrial fibrillation as well.  You need to see your doctor and many an Electrophysiologist - a cardiologist who specialized in heart rhythms. You need to see a Doc and verify if you have/had afib. Then some basic workup to see if the why can be elucidated. You may or may not need treatment but should be sure the decision is made from the proper information.

4208	Q:50464A:231185	Is there a difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest? A heart attack-or   myocardial infarction  -occurs when the blood and oxygen supply to a part of the heart is interrupted due to blockage of one or more of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. This causes the part of the heart supplied by that artery to die if the blockage is not opened very quickly. Cardiac arrest refers to a heart rhythm disturbance-most commonly ventricular fibrillation. In a heart attack a heart artery is blocked  usually by a blood clot  and causes damage to a portion of the heart. While this can be fatal  most people with a heart attack survive with early recognition and treatment. Cardiac arrest is actual stoppage of the heart beating  which can be caused by many things and is rapidly fatal unless immediate CPR and advanced emergency techniques are applied. Cardiac arrest is when the heart actually stops. A heart attack is due to decreased blood flow to a part of the heart muscle. A heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest  but not always. And  there are other etiologies of cardiac arrest besides heart attack.

4212	Q:129850A:196966	Ventricular tachycardia is what? Normal heart rhythm arises in specialized cells within the right atrium called the sinus node and then is propagated over specialized conducting tissue into both ventricles. When an irritable focus in a ventricle begins firing independently repeatedly or in a repetitive loop  initiating it's own renegade rhythm at a rapid rate  it's called ventricular (where it starts) tachycardia (rate >100).

4214	Q:40806A:1106018	What is pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation? This still remains unknown to a large extent. We know the pathophysiology is not the same in everyone. Many people have afib as a result of frequent bursts of abnormal electrical activity in the pulmonary veins  which enter the heart and trigger atrial muscle fibrillation. However  stretching of atrial muscle can be a stimulus to trigger fibrillation  as can ischemia (limited blood flow) in some. The picture goes something like this: an unknown insult causes mild deposition of scar tissue and changes in the electrical properties of some atrial muscle. The atrium then dilates and more scar deposits. Thereafter  it becomes possible for a focus called a rotor to establish itself  waiting to be triggered by extra beats  usu from pulmonary vein foci. Rarely  the PVs can cause fib alone.

4220	Q:45099A:40439	Can pacemaker fix all cases of atrial fibrillations? A pacemaker can not fix atrial fibrillation(Adib). Pacemakers can help suppress afib in conjunction with medication but can not cure you of it. There are various options for treatment such as medications  cardiac ablations and surgical ablations. Your doctor can discuss all options with you and determine which is the best suited for you. He/she may refer you to an electrophysiologist for more info Pacemaker (PPM) are used to treat a slow heart rate.  Most patient with atrial fibrillation (Afib) have a fast heart rate.  Sometimes a PPM in combination with an AV node ablation is used to control heart rate but the patient is left in Afib.  There are other types of ablation available to cure Afib. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat  of the upper chambers of the heart. Its greatest danger is the formation of bloodclots within the heart which can trravel  up to the brain and cause a stroke.

4222	Q:52951A:68056	I have atrial fibrillaiton and have no success controlling it. im looking for advice on possible ablation? If your atrial fibrillation is bothersome  and it can not be controlled by medications  then considering a catheter ablation is reasonable.  The success rate varies depending on how long you've had AF  and other clinical factors  but is usually around 60-70%.  This is typically a better success rate than medications alone. Possibilities are AV node ablation which is burning the AV node with radio frequency  RF  ablation or ablation of the atrial fibrillation which requires scarring of the surrounding pulmonary vein. In some cases AV node ablation may result in the need for a pacemaker.

4232	Q:131633A:233935	Atrial fibrillation versus ventricular fibrillation. Causes and cures? Ventricular fibrillation is from the bottom chamber; VF is worse; it usually causes cardiac arrest which is often fatal. Atrial fibrillation - from the top chamber- while not as severe  also has significant health risks. It increases the risk of stroke  which can be disabling or fatal. Ventricular is lethal instantly. A fib is not lethal and treated with medications or ablation.

4233	Q:80204A:129623	Can cardiac arrhythmia be cured? When an arrhythmia happens because of metabolic changes or changes in blood flow reversing the problem can   cure the arrhythmia.    Other arrhythmias can be ablated with catheters to prevent their recurrennce.  However  arrhythmia that occurs becuase of degenerative changes or scarring often recur. Some arrhythmias have definitive treatments (atrial flutter  re-entry tachycardias)  others have helpful treatments (atrial fibrillation and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia)  and others you can reduce the risk of side effects and risk of death.

4235	Q:649667A:1243321	How bad is artial fibrillation? Can someone with this live for a long time if caught early? If it weren&#x27;t for stroke risk  afib would be nothing but an annoyance. Sadly  afib does significantly increase your risk for stroke and medications should at least be considered to help decrease that risk. Other drugs should be used only if the symptoms bother you. Unless you have a second  very rare condition  you will NOT die of afib. Atrial fibrillation  Cerebral vascular accident  Fibrillation  Premature  Stroke
4236	Q:16370A:517175	What are the risks of going into atrial fibrillation? There are several risks associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). The first is that AF may cause the heart rate to go up which can cause symptoms of dizziness  palpitations and even syncope. Another  more serious risk associated with AF is the increased risk of stroke if left untreated. Finally  if the heart rate continues to run high for long periods of time  heart muscle damge can occur. The presence of atrial fibrillation increases the overall stroke risk in a patient  however  going into the rhythm is not the time of greatest risk. Any   risk   is thus likely to be related only to the symptoms experienced during the fibrillation.

4237	Q:97824A:186391	Is atrial fibrillation or flutter a more serious condition? They both are risk factors for stroke and can cause similar symptoms.  The main difference is that flutter is easy to cure by ablation. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are both common arrythmias. Flutter tends to degenerate into fibrillation; the difference is that flutter tends to be regular and fibrillation irregular. Generally speaking  irregular is worse than regular because there is a higher risk of clots forming in the heart which can then cause strokes and other potential problems. Most flutter will become fibrillation.

4238	Q:40965A:517177	Does anyone know a person who had a cardioversion for atrial fibrillation? Cardioversion is used in some patients with atrial fibrillation in an attempt to return to sinus rhythm (the normal rhythm). This is usually done in newly confirmed diagnoses of afib.  Before elective cardioversion  the doctor also needs to be sure there is no clot already present in the heart. If converted to sinus  long-term Coumadin may not be necessary. It is needed for a short period however. We perform cardioversions as an absolutely routine part of our practice in cardiac electrophysiology. It is a safe and well-tolerated procedure which can restore normal rhythm for many patients.

4239	Q:17028A:768971	When is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator used to treat patients with arrhythmias? When the risk for cardiac arrest is high enough  a physician may recommend a patient get an ICD.  This might be for patients with a weak heart  genetic disease (like HOCM  long QT  ARVD)  or someone who has survived a cardiac arrest already. When the patient has Ischemic Cardiomyopathy  Ejection Fraction between 36-40% with inducible ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia  ICD's are utilized in patients who are at risk for sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmias.  These can be patients who already have significant structural heart disease or may have already suffered a sudden death episode.  Also  they are utilized in patient's who have certain familial conditions which may predispose them to sudden death.

4240	Q:817410A:1172552	Does the heart stop beating when one is having a cardiac arrest? Can be ventricular fibrillation  tachycardia or standstill.Nevertheless  no pulse and no effective blood pressure  fainting  and death if not corrected. A heart attack is when a blood vessel to the heart blocks off and a part of the heart is damaged. A cardiac arrest can be the result of a heart attack. Cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly stops pumping for one reason or another. A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest isn&#x27;t necessarily caused by a heart attack. It canbe an ineffective heart rhythm.

4241	Q:244665A:351556	Which medicines are good for atrial fibrillation? Some meds are good to control the heart rate in  AF  others are to try to control the rhythm and maintain normal sinus rhythm. In addition  blood thinners (anticoagulant meds) need to be considered for some people. So  there is not an easy answer. If this applies to you and you are only 40  you should also consider a curative ablation procedure. Heart  Sinus  Ablation  Anticoagulant  Blood  Rhythm  Heart rate  Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation
4242	Q:41667A:135759	I can't decide: implantable cardioverter defibrillator or heart bypass surgery? This is a type of question you should take up with a physician who specializes in heart disease.  There is no answer applicable to the general population.  The ansewr to this question must be individualized to YOU and your circumstances. Bypass surgery (CABG) treats the blockages in the heart vessels  while the defibrillator (ICD) treats dangerous heart beats such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. A person may need both  depending on their medical condition.

4243	Q:17025A:266675	What benefit does the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator give to patients who have had a cardiac arrest or heart attack? depending on the reason for cardiac arrest  an automatic implantable defibrillator can be very effective in preventing a second cardiac arrest in the future. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are used to treat ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation  which if untreated  may cause a fatal cardiac arrest.  ICDs can often quickly treat these conditions before permanent brain or heart damage can be done.  ICDs are not used to treat or prevent heart attacks  which are a   plumbing   issue.

4245	Q:16375A:107009	What is the difference between atrial fibrillation and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation? Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation refers to the subset of patients with atrial fibrillation not associated with valvular heart disease  but constitutes the vast majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Afib is the most common heart rhythm disturbance that we treat as cardiologists and can occur in a number of clinical settings and in association with other diseases both cardiac and non-cardiac.

4246	Q:16342A:397621	Can a person continue to work a warehouse job if he has atrial fibrillation? yes.  Only stipulation is that if you are on blood thinners (coumadin  pradaxa  etc.) you would be at a higher risk of bleeding if you got hurt. But the heart rate  blood pressure and blood thinner need to be addressed appropriately.

4247	Q:88236A:145734	My doc says I've got cardiac arrhythmia. What does this mean? This is an irregularity of your heart beat and can range from mostly harmless to life-threatening.  You need to speak to your primary care doctor to determine which variation you have and the appropriate treatment (or no-treatment) options.  Many of these may even need referral to a cardiologist (heart specialist) BUT speak to your primary care physician to determine the correct course of action. Arrhythmia ranges from the benign such as PVC's in the setting of a Normal heart to the serious such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in the setting of significant heart disease.  the latter are both ventricular arrhythmias.  Te are a host if atrial arrhythmias as well.  You need to get specifics about your arrhythmia Translated into plain english:  your heart is not beating perfect like a metronome :-) This can be as simple and benign as a skipped beat (everybody has those) to life-threathening as in ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. And then there is everything in between. Ask your doctor for a more specific definition and explanation!!!

4249	Q:560063A:841279	Sometimes I have heart palpitations. Should I be worried? Palpitations are the symptom manifestation of everything from the more benign Isolated PVC or ectopic beat to more complex rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.  To determine the cause you would be thoroughly evaluated.  See a doctor. The best way to diagnose palpitations is to record them. Your doctor can prescribe a monitor that you can wear which will allow your heart rhythm to be recorded. The recorded rhythm during your symptoms will be very helpful in getting to the bottom of it.

4251	Q:549725A:828983	Can cardiac ischemia cause arrhythmias? If so  how? Cardiac ischemia causes lack of blood flow to the heart muscle and can trigger ventricular arrhythmia. Premature ventricular contraction is common.  In severe cases  it can also lead to ventricular tachycardia ( consecutive fast heart beat from the ventricle of the heart). Sometimes with heart attack   fatal ventricular fibrillation (very fast irregular abnormal beats from ventricle) can occur.

4252	Q:16362A:70104	If I have a blood pressure of 120/80  is it possible that I will suffer from atrial fibrillation? Blood pressure and fibrillation are related in that structural changes in the heart can ultimately lead to fibrillation  but in the short term  blood pressure does not generally provoke afib.  There is a common link in adrenaline-like chemicals in your blood which can both raise BP and trigger fibrillation  but that's a longer story. The blood pressure is not necessarily connected with atrial fibrillation. You can have a normal blood pressure as your describe and still acquire atrial fibrillation.

4253	Q:23623A:44577	How is atrial fibrillation usually treated? Control & is specific to individual...talk to your physician Beta Blockers and Digoxin are often used first  to slow down the heart when there is rapid heart rate of AF.  In some patients  electric shocks can be utilized to convert the irregular rate of AF to normal.

4256	Q:348027A:503025	Difference between anxiety and atrial fibrillation symptoms? Sometime s they can mimic each other. Usually anxiety or panic disorder will involve more global symptoms of panic feeling of doom while AFIB may be more limited to palpitations or shortness of breath . If you are not sure see your doctor With fibrillation  the heart fluttering usually precedes the emotions of anxiety  but this can be extremely difficult to sort out clinically.  We usually just measure the rhythm directly with something called a Holter or (different device) an event monitor to sort this out. With a. fib you would have extremely irregular pulse  there are other differences of course  but this one is the easiest one to figure out on your own  if it fast and irregular go to ER ASAP.

4257	Q:499430A:744839	What is the definition or description of: Ventricular assist device? When the heart function has deteriorated to the point where transplantation is considered  time to transplantation can be obtained by the use of an assist device. This can restore function to the heart  and preserve end organ function. In some cases  the cause of the cardiac dysfunction can resolve with use of the device  and it can be remove at a later time. Some patients with heart failure are unable to be treated with the normal medications and require mechanical assistance. These mechanical devices take over part of the work of the left ventricle  thus venticular assist device.

You won't see it because of the vfib waves. Ventricular fibrillation  Contraction  Electrocardiogram  Fibrillation Fibrillation  Ventricular fibrillation
4260	Q:17459A:26599	Is a sinus tachycardia same thing as supraventricular tachycardia?   Supra-ventricular   means 'above the ventricle' and the sinus node is indeed above the ventricle  so ST is one type of SVT.  Atrial fibrillation  flutter  ectopic atrial tachycardia all fit this description.  Usually when talking about SVT (or PSVT)  we refer to a rhythm coming from another specific source  such as a re-entry loop. Sinus tachycardia I a normal physiological increase in heart rate and can happen with exercise   fever etc. supra ventricular tachycardia is an abnormal rhythm usually caused by short circuits or re- entry Sinus tachycardia is the normal fast heart rate that results from a stressful situation  physically or emotionally (running  being upset  having fever  etc...).  SVT is an arrhythmia that usually requires abnormalities of the electrical conduction system of the heart  and if frequent and troubling needs directed treatment.

4261	Q:388079A:598046	Should my sister have a pacemaker placed? She is 83 years old and in faily good health   I feel that much of her cardiac issues are drug induced by prescription drugs.She is not a candidate for open heart surgey and refuses extraordinary means  such as e If your sister has really gone into ‚Äòv-fib‚Äô twice  she may not be in as good of a health status as you may think.  V-fib stands for ventricular fibrillation  a life threatening heart rhythm abnormalities from the bottom chambers of the heart that is so rapid and disorganized that the heart is essentially stops pumping blood out of the heart effectively and thus can lead to sudden and unexpected cardiac death.  If v-fib persists  the only way to terminated it is to ‚Äòshock the patient‚Äô out of it with a defibrillator.  The fact that you mention that she is not a candidate for ‚Äòopen heart surgery‚Äô leads me to believe that she may suffer from with heart artery blockages  severe heart disease  or one of the many other serious heart problems.  Unless your sister suffers from a relatively rare condition called ‚Äòbradycardia-dependent v-fib‚Äô (life threatening fat heart rhythm from the bottom chambers that are triggered from slow heart eat from the bottom chambers)  chances are that your sister needs is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)  not a pacemaker. ICDs are expensive devices that can be associated with complications such as death  stroke  heart attacks  infections  blood clots  rupture of blood vessels  perforation of the heart muscle  bleeding  etc.  While the risk versus benefit ratio is unique to each patient  their condition  the expertise and experience of their physician and that of the he staff of the facility where the procedure is done  among selected patients  the procedural risk of these procedures is substantially less than the risk of not having it done.

Atrial fibrillation by itself does not produce symptoms usually  it is often the fast heart rate that may result from it that causes the symptoms of   fluttering   in the chest.  Even with fast heart rates some people do not feel anything in their chest because not everyone is as sensitive to these things to the same degree.  Some people  feel fluttering and it is not related to their heart at all.

4267	Q:388033A:598043	When should I be concerned of rapid heart rate? Experiencing rapid heart rate for several months The medical term for a rapid heart rhythm is tachycardia. There are many different types of tachycardias and their clinical importance depends on several key factors with heart rate being only one of those. Other important variable include the type of tachycardia  patient‚Äôs age  other associated health problems  etc. For example  while two people may have the same ‚Äòheart rate‚Äô (say 175 ‚Äòbeats per minutes‚Äô or BPM)  the prognosis is very different in a young health person who reaches that rate only while running a marathon on a hot day (sinus tachycardia or normal fast heart rhythm) than in a heart attack survivor with a history of heart failure who has just been resuscitated from an out of hospital cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia (a life threatening from the bottom chambers of the heart).Other common tachycardias include atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).  While both of these tachycardias involve the upper chambers of the heart  only atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of strokes. In most patients with atrial fibrillation  their stroke risk can be decreased with the use of blood thinners such as warfarin. Among patients with tachycardias  symptoms can range from nothing to palpitations  shortness of breath and passing out to death.While most abnormal heart rhythms can be diagnosed and treated by well-trained primary care physicians  cardiac electrophysiologists (cardiologists specialized in rhythm disturbances) are the experts in this area.

4270	Q:128423A:196019	Would an echocardiogram detect an Atrial Fibrillation? No  not unless you happened to be in AF at the time of the echo.  It can detect signs that a heart is prone to atrial fibrillation  like enlarged atria. Although an echocardiogram can detect atrial fibrillation  there are easier ways to diagnose it. Your doctor should be able to tell if your pulse is irregular and confirm afib with a simple EKG.

4272	Q:110893A:176107	Is an irregular heart beat most commonly atrial fibrillation or something else? It depends in what time of person the irregular heart beat is happening.  Someone young may be more likely to have premature atrial or ventricular contractions (PACs or PVCs) than AF. The most common irregular heart beat is sinus arrhythmia which is a respiratory variation in the regularity  a perfectly normal heart rhythm and not indicative of any disease. The most common ABNORMAL heart irregularity is atrial fibrillation  with some 2-3 million people having this heart rhythm.

4273	Q:911383A:1315151	What is synchronized external cardioversion? When we shock ventricular fibrillation we just deliver the shock as soon as possible. When we cardiovert a rhythm like atrial fibrillation that kind of shock can cause ventricular fibrillation so we synchronize the shock to a safe part of the ecg complex. We call this synchronized cardioversion. this is a procedure using patches placed on the skin over your heart. A synchronized &quot;shock&quot; Is given at a particular time during the heart beat.

4274	Q:102604A:266525	Likelihood of fatal fibrillation? Presumably you are asking about ventricular fibrillation  since atrial fibrillation would hardly ever by fatal.  The risk of VF  or cardiac arrest  varies widely depending on what underlying heart conditions exist.  Cardiac arrest occurs to about 400 000 Americans annually.  The risk in some serious heart conditions may be 20-40% a year.  For most people  it is much less than 1% a year. Ventricular fibrillation  Heart  Fibrillation  Atrial fibrillation  Heart attack  Cardiac arrest
4275	Q:16568A:55957	What disorders can cardioversion be used to treat? We use it to treat rapid abnormal rhythms especially those causing instability. Cardioversion can convert most ventricular arrhythmias (i.e. originating from bottom part of the heart) to normal rhythm  and several supraventricular (i.e. from top part of the heart). Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly cardioverted rhythm  with very high success rates. Other supraventricular rhythms (e.g. PSVT  atrial tachycardia  AVNRT) can also be treated  though not as reliably.

4276	Q:370615A:813901	What is the life expectancy for people with Ventricular Tachycardia? How serious is Ventricular Tachycardia  and what kind of treatment is available? Most forms of ventricular tachycardia (VT) are very serious  and require close management by a cardiologist. Conditions that cause scarring or enlargement of the heart can lead to VT  but sometimes VT happens by itself. Treating ventricular tachycardia is a multifaceted approach. If there is an underlying condition causing the VT  then that must be optimally treated. There are several medications available to help stabilize the heart rhythm and prevent episodes of VT  but these should be prescribed and monitored by an expert. Depending on the cause and severity of the VT  some patients also require defibrillators. A defibrillator is a device similar to a pacemaker  but with the capability to identify VT and convert the rhythm with an electrical shock. VT has a wide spectrum of severity. Some kinds cause no symptoms and are benign and others deteriorate rapidly to ventricular fibrillation and cause death. In the setting of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (your other question)  VT is more serious and may require placement of an ICD. ICDs have been shown to greatly improve prognosis.

4277	Q:370625A:808197	Am I at an increased risk of stroke? With atrial fibrillation  am I at increased risk of having a stroke? Yes  atrial fibrillation increases the chances of having a stroke because there is an increased risk of blood clots forming in the heart which can then travel to the brain. The risk is proportional to the amount of other stroke risk factors. In other words  the increased risk is small in people without other health conditions  but risk increases with additional risk factors such as advancing age  hypertension  diabetes  heart failure and if there has been a prior stroke. You should talk to your doctor about your stroke risk if you have atrial fibrillation. If the risk is moderate or high  this would warrant taking the blood thinner warfarin. If the stroke risk is small  you should at least take an aspirin. If you possess atrial fibrillation  it should be cardioverted and/or controlled  and if not possible you should be taking an anticoagulant.  Several choices  so discuss with your cardiologist.

4278	Q:41973A:59724	How do you assess left ventricular function? Ventricular function represents a quantification of the heart's pumping ability.  Typically 55-65% of the blood is squeezed out with each beat.  This can be assessed by imaging the heart.  The most common way is an echocardiogram.  We sometimes perform MRIs of the heart  nuclear scan  or contrast ventriculography. This is most commonly done with an echocardiogram  an ultrasound of the heart. It is also assessed when dye is injected into the heart at the time of a cardiac catheterization or by the injection of radioactive substances into the heart  which is commonly done as part of a stress test.

4280	Q:17159A:82216	What is the most common complication of early myocardial infarction? The most common complication is arrhythmia which can occur very early in MI. If it's ventricular fibrillation as it tends to be in about 50% of cases  the result is sudden death. Heart block and atrial fibrillation also occur. Other common complications are recurrent pain and congestive heart failure. Less common is thromboembolism (systemic and pulmonary) causing stroke or PE and pericarditis. the most common early complication of myocardial infarction is arrhythmia typically ventricular fibrillation.  If this occurs in the hospital  it responds promptly to cardioversion.  If it occurs outside the hospital it can result in sudden death.  The highest period of risk occurs in the first 48 hours.

4281	Q:87486A:141510	is a v fib  where the bottom of the heat flutters and the blood does not go to the rest of the body  considered a heart attack? It is not a heart attack.  It is a serious and potentially fatal arrhythmia.  It can lead to a heart attack or be a warning sign for high risk of heart attack. ventricular fibrillation or vfib  means bottom chambers of the heart fibrillate  not flutter  however flutter would lead to vfib. A heart attack or myocardial infarction may lead to vfib. However vfib may happen without heart attack Ventricular fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) that can result from a heart attack.

4285	Q:667664A:1024107	What is the best treatment for atrial fibrillation? 2 Strategies: Rate and Rhythm control. For rate control  diltiazem is generally slightly more effective than beta blockers like metoprolol. For rhythm control  drugs work for some. Among these  amiodarone and dofetilide are the most effective for long-term control  but each has serious concerns. Catheter ablation has a ~4% risk of major complications  but is more effective than any drug therapy. Treatment of AF depends on the TYPE of AF  the age of the patient  the presence or absence of underlying heart disease  and patient's personal preferences (more medications vs. procedural approach (ablation). You should discuss this with your doctor or an electrophysiologist.

4286	Q:16434A:73922	Can radiofrequency cardiac ablation help cure arrhythmia? Oblation is a widely used in extremely successful procedure for a variety of different cardiac rhythm problems. The success rate for the procedure can range from 70% for atrial fibrillation to 85% for atrial tachycardia  and is much as 98% for rhythms like atrial flutter and Wolf Parkinson White  (AVRT).  A cardiac electrophysiologist can give you an answer specific to your situation. It's an excellent modality for certain arrhythmias like Wolf-Parkinson-White and refractory atrial fibrillation. It is also helpful for symptomatic ventricular tachycardia in conjunction with a defibrillator. Because it's invasive and carries some risk  it's not usually a first line therapy but there are exceptions. The more general term for the procedure is catheter ablation. In essence the abnormal tissue in the heart that is supporting or causing the arrhythmia can be destroyed by either burning it (radiofrequency ablation) or by freezing it (cryoablation). For many arrhythmias  this treatment is highly effective with cure rates approaching 100%.

4287	Q:40792A:80532	Are there any new treatments for atrial fibrillation? The most recent advancement in atrial fibrillation treatment  available in the United States is a cryogenic balloon technology brought to market by Medtronic. However  clinical trials are underway of some very exciting new technology I am not at liberty to discuss which will likely be available on the market within the next 2 to 3 years. There are multiple ways to treat atrial fibrillation:1. Control the heart rate with medications that control the heart rate.2. Try to convert patients in nornal rhythm and keep them in normal rhythm with medications specific for that purpose.3. Minimize the risk of a stroke with medications that thin the blood4.

4294	Q:35891A:58378	Will a Taser kill someone who has an implanted defibrillator? There are reported deaths due to Taser use  presumably because the Taser provoked a lethal cardiac arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation). An implanted defibrillator would treat that - so  if anything  a Taser would be &quot;safer&quot; in someone with an ICD. I&#x27;m not aware that it&#x27;s been tested and wouldn&#x27;t count on it  though. Depending on the vector of the shock  it could theoretically deactivate the ICD. A Taser might damage implanted devices  although some studies done on pigs found the 5-seconds of high voltage did not damage pacemakers or implanted defibrillators. Those devices likely have safety features to block high voltage electrical currents. Not sure if a defribillator could reset the heart if a Taser created an abnormal rhythm  but the studies suggest the defribrillator would still work.

4295	Q:375636A:992086	How long should I be on blood thinners before I have a cardioversion procedure? I've been in atriol fibrulation for approx. 2 months Prior to recieving a cardioversion  your health care provider needs to ensure that there are no clots in the heart. If there is a clot in the heart at the time of the cardioversion  the patient is at high risk for suffering a stroke or a heart attack. Upon the diagnosis of arrhythmia  a patient will be placed on a blood thinning regimen  typically 4-6 weeks prior to undergoing a cardioversion. (A blood test can be performed to ensure your levels are in 'therapeutic' range). However  the presence of clots anywhere in your body and heart could cause the cardioversion procedure to be postposed. Talk to your health care provider about why your procedure has been held 4 weeks before and 3 weeks after at a  minimum. This is the standard of care. Alternatively  you can undergo transesophageal echo. If that shows no clot  you can proceed immediately but still must take medication for at least 3 weeks afterward.

4297	Q:16535A:107132	What is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy? Also called Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD)  it is a cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle. The muscle of the right ventricle is replaced by fat and fibrosis  which causes abnormal heart rhythms. It is a progressive disease. There is a genetic basis for ARVD. ARVC is a cardiomyopathy that results in partial or total replacement of right ventricular muscle by fat or fibrous tissue. The principal problem is life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances which are the cause of death in these patients. Medications can suppress the arrhythmias but sometimes an AICD is needed. There is a genetic form of ARVC. Cardiac MRI is useful for diagnosis.

4302	Q:602247A:979797	What does Atrial Fibrillation look like in EKG or Holter? If you are already taking beta blockers to suppress arrhythmia  does it mask AF in EKG? Atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular  (no pattern to the rhythm). Three issues with AF: Rate. The rate of untreated AF is typically around 150 beats per minute which is too fast; secondly  whether it should be converted to a normal rhythm. And thirdly whether Anticoagulation is needed. There are drugs to slow down the rate and drugs for conversion. A beta blocker would tend to slow down th The key is in the atrial signal on the ECG. The normal discharge from the top chambers (atria) which is the   p   wave is now missing and there is either a coarse erratic signal from the top or sometimes even a near flat signal. This will make the bottom chamber signal also erratic/irregular but the key to the definition is in the signal from the top.

4303	Q:16366A:73307	Is atrial fibrillation inherited? If atrial fibrillation is inherited  it is most often because of some other associated condition which is also inherited. There are rare types of atrial fibrillation which can be inherited  but generally speaking it follows either aging or other disease processes. there is a gene that makes the tendency to get it more likely  but most a fib is due to environmental and aquired factors such as age  valvular heart disease and alcohol Aging gracefully  Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Genetic Atrial fibrillation  Alcohol  Heart  Fibrillation  Gene  Genetic Aging gracefully  Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Genetic Atrial fibrillation  Alcohol  Heart  Fibrillation  Gene  Genetic Aging gracefully  Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Genetic Atrial fibrillation  Alcohol  Heart  Fibrillation  Gene  Genetic Aging gracefully  Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Genetic Atrial fibrillation  Alcohol  Heart  Fibrillation  Gene  Genetic
4304	Q:245830A:517122	Is it bad if my atrial fibrillation is around 150 beats per minute? Yes. You are likely to have symptoms of palpitations  shortness of breath and chest discomfort . Also if your heart rate remains elevated for long periods of time it can cause a decrease in heart function. See yoyr doctor ASAP. The latest data available to us from the clinical trials suggest that an appropriate target is a resting heart rate less than 110 bpm. Periodic rise in the heart rate to greater than 150 bpm is not harmful  however if this is your rate the majority of time  cardiac dysfunction may eventually result.

4311	Q:94957A:158504	When will a paramedic use a defibrillator? When a patient isn't breathing or doesn't have a pulse.  The machine will analyze the heart rhythm and the decision to shock will be made at that time during CPR. Defibrillators are used to treat the abnormal heart rhythms ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.  The defibrillator will cause a strong electrical current to pass through the heart with the goal of acting as a   reset   button  allowing the heart's rhythm to return to a normal speed and pathway.

4312	Q:230792A:517206	How can you tell the difference between atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation ? They look different on an EKG.  Atrial flutter is regular and atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular.  Often the treatment is similar as an outpatient.  Symptomatically they would probably feel about the same to a patient. Generally speaking  atrial flutter is conducted in a more regular fashion to the lower chamber of the heart  though this is not always true. The best way to tell the difference between the two is to obtain an EKG.

4313	Q:624219A:939960	What's the underlying causes of atrial fibrillation?  ECHO done was normal. There are many causes  such as ischemia  infection  trauma  neurological  metabolic and etc... You need to know what caused it. Look out for left atrial enlargement or mitral valve narrowing/leakiness on echocardiogram  which would indicate structural heart problems.. If echo is totally normal  rule out Hyperthyroidism  sleep apnea  excessive alcohol intake Atrial fibrillation  ECHO  Fibrillation
4314	Q:211110A:330938	What is the disease where ventricular fibrillation happens all the time or a lot of the time? V-fib that lasts more than a few seconds is typically lethal and results in sudden death.  Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is a different thing entirely  which is a common heart rhythm abnormality.  Some people live in constant afib  some people their afib is come-and-go.  If it is afib you are referring to  it is commonly managed with a combination of medications and procedures. Atrial fibrillation  Heart  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Ventricular fibrillation
4315	Q:224945A:517132	What is the difference between atrial fibrillation and flutter? Atrial fib is a chaotic  irregular contraction of the top chambers of the heart (atria).  Atrial flutter is a rapid  but regular beating of the atria.  Both can lead to the same symptoms  both can cause irregular pulse  both have a risk of stroke.  Usually flutter is easier to treat with a catheter ablation than AF is.  An EKG can often tell the difference. Atrial flutter is a very organized rhythm in which electricity gets stuck in a loop going round and round  much like cars on a NASCAR racetrack. Atrial fibrillation is a more complex rhythm  in which the majority of the atrium is in chaos  driven by a focus known as a rotor. Atrial fibrillation is much harder to cure than atrial flutter  however rate control is usually better for fibrillation.

4316	Q:17027A:61732	What is the function of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator? These are devices which may detect and automatically treat malignant (life-threatening) arrhythmias. Those include ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. They use either bursts of rapid pacing or one or more high energy shocks. Patients receive these either after an arrhythmic event or prophylactically because they are at risk for these arrhythmias. The device has the abiltiy to sense when your heart is beating in an abnormal and dangerous way which could lead to you passing out or having your heart stop. It then delivers an electric shock to the heart to convert the abnormal rhythm back to normal. The device also can function as a pacemaker if your heart beat becomes too slow.

4317	Q:390866A:1022803	Could Plavix make your heart flutter? I am a 45 year old female and one month ago had an ASD clouser done. I noticed every so often I would have a feeling of fluttering in my heart  at fist thought it was my heart getting used to the device. now I get it Although there have been postmarketing reports of Plavix causing arrhythmia  a mechanism for this has not been established.The likelihood of having fluttering as a result of Plavix therapy is small  and stopping the Plavix could significantly increase your risk of stroke.  ASD closure has been advocated by some as a way to decrease the risk of arrhythmias.  However  new arrhythmias  including atrial fibrillation  can occur in patients following ASD closure.I would urge you to resume the Plavix and discuss your concerns with your doctor. Plavix should not cause any sort of heart arrhythmias.  Most people occasionally feel a flutter in their heart  usually related to harmless irregular beats (atrial or premature ventricular beats) or stress/fatigue/anxiety symptoms.  However  the ASD closure device could also cause irregular heart beats depending on its position.  It would be a good idea to bring it up with your cardiologist.

4318	Q:231743A:517200	What conditions require the use of an automatic electric defibrillator (aed)? If a person is without a pulse  not breathing  & unresponsive  apply the AED & it will tell you if it should shock the person. It detects a   shockable rhythm   which is most likely ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Well  only ventricular fibrillation  ventricular tachycardia and ventricular flutter REQUIRE the use of a defibrillator  though we also use them to treat atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in symptomatic patients.

4320	Q:107732A:266575	Sometimes i feel just slightly out of breath for no reason. could this be atrial fibrillation? But it could also be one of many other medical conditions. Go see a doctor and have a thorough medical exam. Possibly.  You can check your pulse during these episodes and see if it is irregular  which may be a clue the shortness of breath is coming from some heart arrhythmia.  To make the diagnosis officially  some recording of the heart rhythm needs to be made. This can be via 12-lead EKG  24-hr holter monitor  or 30-day loop monitor.

4321	Q:200779A:517208	What is the ecg finding for an atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter? There are small waves from the atrial activity on 12-lead ECG.  Normally these are single  well defined P waves during sinus rhythm.  For flutter  they are rapid and regular  often with a   sawtooth   pattern.  For fib  the atrial activity is very random  irregular  and sometimes hard to see.   Atypical flutter can be hard to distinguish from   coarse   AF by ECG. In atrial fibrillation  there are no P waves seen  or the P waves are highly irregular and not directly correlated with the QRS complexes. In atrial flutter constant  regularized activity is seen  generally without a fixed baseline.

4324	Q:35770A:62380	How can you tell when someone goes into cardiac arrest? that is the hallmark of cardiac arrest.  the heart goes into ventricular fibrillation which is a heart rhythm that does not permit the blood to be pumped to the organs  esp the heart and brain.  by shocking -using an AED or a cardiac defibrillator the heart can be shocked into a normal sinus rhythm. this is what is going on when you see those shows where they say   all clear  shock.   Cardiac arrest as the name implies is when the heart stops.  When your heart stops beating  blood carrying oxygen does not flow to your body and brain.  The body ceases all functions (you stop breathing  you are unconscious  the skin turns pale or blue).  The best way to tell if someone is in cardiac arrest is to use a heart monitor (like carried by EMS personel) to monitor activity of the heart.

What are the risks/benefits of other treatment options? There is no way to answer all these questions here. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers will slow heart rate. Digoxin is frequently used for the same things.Discuss with your doctor if you have risk factors for stroke. If yes  blood thinners may be indicated The treatment of atrial fibrillation has two important components: 1) treating the rhythm  and 2) preventing stroke. There are two strategies for treating the rhythm. The first is called the rate control strategy  and involves using medicines to prevent the heart rate from going too fast. These medicines do not prevent atrial fibrillation episodes  but are generally effective at preventing fast rhythms and also tend to have few side effects. This is a good strategy for people who do not have severe symptoms from atrial fibrillation  such as older less active people. The second strategy is called the rhythm control strategy  and involves using medications that are designed to maintain normal sinus rhythm and prevent episodes of atrial fibrillation. This strategy may be more desirable for people who are vey symptomatic when in atrial fibrillation such as young  active people. Unfortunately  this strategy tends to be less successful because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common. The rhythm control medications also tend to have more side effects than the rate control medicines  and in some cases the side effects can be severe. Neither strategy is better than the other at preventing stroke.For stroke prevention  warfarin (also called Coumadin) is typically used for people at moderate or high risk. This medication has been shown to be superior in preventing stroke  but it also increases the risk of dangerous bleeding because it is a blood thinner. Patients at lower risk for stroke may just take an aspirin tablet daily. This has a lower bleeding risk than warfarin.Lastly  some people are candidates for surgical or catheter-based ablation procedures. These procedures can cure atrial fibrillation  but are not always successful and not all people are good candidates.

4331	Q:16572A:63201	What is the difference between a defibrillator and a pacemaker? A pacemaker is used in the case of slow  heart beats or blocked electrical conduction between upper and lower chambers (AV block). A defibrillator will 'shock' (defibrillate) the heart in the case if abnormal life threatening fast heart beats (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). All defibrillators have a back-up pacemaker in them  but pacemakers cannot defibrillate the heart. Some pacemakers include defibrillators and some do not.  A   regular   pacemaker simply sets the heart rate or helps to control the rate at which the heart beats.  An implated defibrillator  usually is also a pacemaker  but constantly monitors the heart for dangerous heart rate types and delivers an eclectric shock to try and return the irregular heart rate to normal.

4332	Q:16358A:55162	How can food affect atrial fibrillation? Atrial fibrillation can be aggravated by medications such as stimulants  decongestants   caffeine  alcohol.  Daily nutrition usually does not affect rhythm. afib is a rythm that can be very fast and can cause a stroke from blod clots going to the brain. many patients are on coumadin a blood thinner that works through vitamin k. so if the patient eats green leafy veges and other foods high in vitamin k  it can reverse the coumadin and make pt suseptable to stroke. foods and items high in caffiene like coffee chocolate etc can stimulate the heart rate Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Nutrition Vitamin K  Heart rate  Atrial fibrillation  Anticoagulant  Coumadin  Vitamin deficiency  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Warfarin Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Nutrition Vitamin K  Heart rate  Atrial fibrillation  Anticoagulant  Coumadin  Vitamin deficiency  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Warfarin Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Nutrition Vitamin K  Heart rate  Atrial fibrillation  Anticoagulant  Coumadin  Vitamin deficiency  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Warfarin Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Nutrition Vitamin K  Heart rate  Atrial fibrillation  Anticoagulant  Coumadin  Vitamin deficiency  Cerebral apoplexy  Heart  Brain  Warfarin

4342	Q:16436A:138937	How often do cardiac ablation surgeries result in complications requiring pacemakers implantation? There are certain procedures in very specific patients where that risk is high  but generally the risk is much less than 1%. In ablating cardiac dysrhythmias  the ablation catheters can sometimes affect the conduction to or from the atrio-venticular node (AVN). This is an important regulator of heart rate and if affected the reslutant 'escape rhythm' may be too slow to accomadte normal activity; thus a pacemaker is required. In some conditions  like atrial fibrillation  the goal may be AVN ablation and pacemaker implant It depends on the ablation type: almost never for WPW  atrial fibrillation/flutter or ventricular tachycardia; 1% or less for AVNRT (atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia). In AVNRT  there is an extra 'lane' in the AV node that conducts electrical impulses leading to tachycardia and the ablation can unintentionally damage the whole AV node resulting in heart block and need for pacemaker.

4343	Q:16348A:54298	Can hypertension cause atrial fibrillation? Hypertension can cause congestive heart failure. The increased heart pressures from the congestive heart failure can then lead to distention of the atria and subsequent atrial fibrillation. atrial fibrillation is an irregularly irregular heart rhythm   it can  happen when the atrium( upper chamber of the heart) is enlarged. hypertension causes the heart to work harder  develops hypertrophy to have enough force to push the blood  forward from the ventricle ( lower chamber of the heart); the atrium in turn enlarges to push blood to ventricle and eventually dilates then A-fib develops Atrial fibrillation  Congestive heart failure  Fibrillation  Heart  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Ventricle  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Congestive heart failure  Fibrillation  Heart  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Ventricle  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Congestive heart failure  Fibrillation  Heart  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Ventricle  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Congestive heart failure  Fibrillation  Heart  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Ventricle  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Congestive heart failure  Fibrillation  Heart  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Ventricle  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Congestive heart failure  Fibrillation  Heart  High blood pressure  Hypertension Atrial fibrillation  Heart  Blood  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Ventricle  High blood pressure  Hypertension

It is a computer and programmed to do its functions. They are very effective but not perfect It detects fast heart beats above a threshold set by the cardiologist and programmed into the defibrillator and delivers a shock or ATP - pacemaker override  depending on the heart rate.  It will deliver subsequent shocks depending on the heart rate it detects.

4346	Q:390895A:599670	I have been to the ER for a rapid heartbeat. Sometimes it's diagnosed as sinus tachycardia and sometimes atrial fibrillation. I have tried Cardyzeme and Metopral without much success. What happens if I don't seek treatment next time? Atrial Fibrillation can be a sign of underlying heart disease  such as mitral valve disease or other conditions that can cause stretching of the atria ‚Ä?? the upper chambers of the heart.  A cardiologist‚Äôs evaluation and an echocardiogram are often useful in ruling out some structural disease affecting your heart.  If there is no structural heart disease  then the principal risk of atrial fibrillation is that blood clots may form in areas of the heart that are not contracting and possibly travel through the bloodstream to cause a stroke.  This risk of a stroke is increased if you are over 65 years old; if you have high blood pressure; if you are female; if you have had a prior stroke  transient ischemic attack (or TIA ‚Ä?? a fleeting stroke)  or other blood clot disorder; if you have diabetes; if you have heart failure; or if you have known vascular disease (heart attack  aneurysm  or limitation of blood flow to the legs).  The more risk factors you have the higher your risk of a stroke.  With one risk factor  many physicians will recommend aspirin therapy  or sometimes more potent blood thinners.  With two or more risk factors  blood thinners are usually recommended.  This should be discussed in detail with your doctor. If  in fact  you have been documented to have atrial fibrillation you should be evaluated by a cardiologist to determine the need for medication/treatments. This will depend on his/her evaluation of your history  associated risk factors  echocardiogram  etc. Not all Atrial fibrillation is treated the same I agree with Dr. Guyton's excellent and thorough answer and would like to emphasize that with atrial fibrillation there are two main issues:1) Heart rate - a fast heart rate is typically what most people present with  and typically can be managed with medications to control heart rate such as the two you described  although there are others. Sustained high heart rates are not good for the heart  but as long as you are not having chest pain  shortness of breath  dizziness  or loss of consciousness then you can call your physician before rushing to the ER.2) Stroke - afib presents a very real increase risk of stroke if not properly treated. For this reason  an accurate diagnosis is a must  and if it is indeed afib the you should discuss with your physician whether you are high enough risk to require blood thinners such as coumadin or Pradaxa. This is a long term risk so can be discussed in the outpatient setting with your docotor or a cardiologist.

4347	Q:291360A:439414	Can a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and av node reentry tachycardia increase the risk for a heart attack? This is a tough one.  If you already have severe coronary disease  fibrillation can produce rapid heart rates which exceed the available blood supply and lead to a heart attack due to   demand ischemia.    The same is true  though even more rare for AVNRT.Afib  but not AVNRT is often a marker of (is seen with) other heart disease which of course puts you at increased risk of heart attack. These dysrhythmias can lead to a malignant dysrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation; the cause of sudden death.

4348	Q:42144A:1240732	What kind of ventricular fibrillation is not dangerous? Ventricular fibrillation is a condition in which there is uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles in the heart  making them quiver rather than contract properly. Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency and a commonly identified arrythmia in cardiac arrest patients. Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency that requires prompt emergency intervention. Ventricular fibrillation means the heart is not mechanically contracting and thus isn&#x27;t pumping blood. There is no kind of ventricular fibrillation that isn&#x27;t life threatening unless it is the kind which is pseudovfib meaning it isn&#x27;t really fibrillating  it just looks that way on the ecg.

4349	Q:84528A:137619	What are the causes of atrial fibrillation and can it be transient. I am a 60 yr old male with treated hypertension and elevated cholesterol.? Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be transient.  If you use alcohol or caffeine in quantity  stop. [seek help if withdrawal occurs].  Be sure your BP is well-treated.  Seek an ideal weight and prudent diet.  Most AF in older individuals is a result of cumulative injury to the conduction system in the heart from thickening/high BP/cholesterol. AF can be due to normal wear and tear as occurs in HTN and the Aging process.  Aging causes insertion of non-conducting tissue (scar) between normal heart cells which is bad.  All old people get this but not all old people get AF. Why?  We know that nests of cells fire crazily at times triggering AF.  These nests are frequently located in pulmonary veins.

4350	Q:131631A:198086	Is ventricular fibrillation the cause of cardiac arrest? Broadly speaking  there are 2 causes of cardiac arrest: ventricular fibrillation and asystole. Ventricular fibrillation is a cardiac arrhythmia that results in the heart being unable to circulate blood. Thus  there is no pulse with this rhythmn. However  there are other cardiac rhythmns that also result in cardiac arrest. it is the most common heart arrhythmia associated with cardiac arrest. It is not exact to call it the cause  since ventricular fibrillation itself has an underlying cause  most commonly coronary artery disease  but there are others.

4351	Q:40968A:30591	How did the defibrillator get named? A defibrillator provides an electrical current that is measured in Joules (a measure of electrical energy).

4355	Q:375746A:992088	Cardioversion - how long do i need to be on blood thinners before i have the procedure done? I've had atriol fibrulation for approx 2 months Upon onset of atrial fibrillation  it will be important for you to be on blood thinners for 4 to 6 weeks to ensure there are no blood clots present in the heart prior to procedure. If there is a blood clot in your heart during the cardioversion procedure  the risk for heart attack and stroke are very high.While on blood thinners  you will have regular appointments to have your blood drawn to ensure therapeutic ranges in the blood. The following blood tests will be assessed: Protime and INR  which test how think your blood is.If at anytime  your blood levels are not in therapeutic range (too high - high risk of bleeding or too low - high risk for clot)  your dosage of blood thinners will be adjusted. 4 weeks before and 3 weeks after at a  minimum. This is the standard of care. Alternatively  you can undergo transesophageal echo. If that shows no clot  you can proceed immediately but still must take medication for at least 3 weeks afterward.

4356	Q:16359A:503158	How can someone stop atrial fibrillation? New onset atrial fibrillation is often self limited  going away by itself.  But the cause dictates the subsequent course.  Thus treating things like high blood pressure  heart valve disease  heart failure  over active thyroid hormones  coronary disease  and avoiding alcohol may be important.  Some drugs are useful to maintain rate and rhythm.  If needed  electric shock (cardioversion) is effective If it's new  it's usually self-limiting. If it doesn't stop on it's own  there's nothing you can do  but your doctor can give you medication that will convert your rhythm and if that fails  it can be electrically converted while you're anesthetized. Note that if you have certain risk factors  you should have your blood thinned prior to any attempt to convert the rhythm. A fib will be more likely in setting of excessive stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.  Alcohol use results in hyperstimulation of sympathetic nerves with adrenalin during the process of alcohol metabolism.  Other factors--pain/fever/breathing  problems/sleep apnea can stimulate a fib episodes too.

4357	Q:639894A:962087	Is cardiac arrest the same thing as a heart attack? A heart attack is when a blood vessel to the heart blocks off and a part of the heart is damaged. A cardiac arrest can be the result of a heart attack. Cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly stops pumping for one reason or another. A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest isn't necessarily caused by a heart attack.

4360	Q:17538A:25871	Are the PVCs related to Wolff Parkinson White (WPW) in any way? WPW is  by definition  an abnormal accessory conduction tract from the atria to the ventricles. Thus arrhythmia related to WPW is an atrial arrhythmia. That said  very fast rhythm in the ventricles may conduct with aberration and mimic ventricular tachycardia. But not PVCs. Wolf Parkinson White syndrome  AKA pre-excitation due to the presence of an accessory pathway would not cause PVC's.  Abnormal conduction of atrial impulses through the accessory pathway will lead to fast heart rates at times  this can become life threatening especially in the setting of atrial fibrillation with an inappropriately high rate of conduction leading to ventricular fibrillation.

4362	Q:370622A:813908	What causes atrial flutter? What is the cause of my atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter?  Will my condition go away on its own? The most common cause of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is a history of high blood pressure (hypertension)  and the conditions are both more common as people age. They can also be associated with other forms of structural heart disease  and numerous other less common causes. Without knowing more about you I cannot say why you specifically have it. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are usually chronic conditions  and do not spontaneously resolve. Treatment option include simply controlling the heart rate since these rhythms tend to go fast (rate control strategy)  or using medicines to try and maintain a normal sinus rhythm and keep the person out of atrial fibrillation or flutter (rhythm control strategy). There are also surgical and minimally invasive procedures that can be offered to try and cure the rhythm. It is also important to realize the both conditions can increase the risk of stroke  and so many people take additional medicine to minimize this risk. You have ventricular tachycardia  atrial fibrillation  and atrial flutter  and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? You have  a little too much going on - you need to either buy a cardiology textbook or be under the regular care of a cardiologist!

4365	Q:133812A:209343	Why digoxin is absolutely contraindicated in a case of ventricular fibrillation? Digoxin can cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias so giving it to a patient with one is certainly not a good idea. digoxin is a heart stimulant with a very narrow range of safe doses. Ventricular tachycardia is very common adverse side effect of digoxin  and would likely make this condition worse or increase the frequency of the episodes. Stimulating a heart that is already beating too fast (tachycardia) could be fatal.

4366	Q:370607A:813897	What causes Atrial Fibrillation? Is stress the main cause of Atrial Fibrillation  and is it genetic? Stress can contribute to high blood pressure  so it certainly is a factor for some people. A stressful event can also trigger an episode of atrial fibrillation in people who already have the condition. Research suggests that there is a genetic contribution to the development of atrial fibrillation  but the genetics are complicated and the syndrome is not inherited in a traditional sense. The main causes of AF are: hypertension  alcohol excess  rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis  mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation  coronary artery disease  aging  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  lung disease  thyroid hormone excess  idiopathic (no identifiable cause)   and rare causes. It can run in families but is not predictably genetic. Stress is actually only a minor factor.

4371	Q:185401A:269860	is there a p wave in ventricular fibrillation? There is usually atrial activity  either the occasional retrograde atrial activation  or just the normal sinus rate progressing along unaffected by the VF.   However  with the continuous ventricular activity in VF  it would typically be impossible to make out a P wave on the surface EKG.  When we have catheters in the heart (during an EP study) we see the atrial activity in VF. There is no organized rhythmn in ventricular fibrillation so no p wave is present. There is also no QRS complex present. There is no blood flow as the heart is quivering so the patient is clinically dead. The heart needs to be shocked as quickly as possible to hopefully restore a normal rhythmn.

4377	Q:16369A:64455	What are the effects of atrial fibrillation? It increases the risk of stroke  which can be disabling or fatal. Additionally  if the AF causes a fast pulse for a prolonged period of time  this may lead to weakening of the heart and cause heart failure.As far as symptoms  it may cause palpitations  shortness of breath  chest pain  syncope  fatigue and sometimes none: some people are asymptomatic The most important effect of atrial fibrillation is the risk of  clots arising in the atrium and causing a stroke when the clot leaves the atrium and lands in the brain. Patients with atrial fib may have decreased exercise tolerance and shortness of breath due exaggerated heart rate response. Patients may have fatigue due to decreased cardiac output. The feeling of palpitations may cause anxiety.

4384	Q:116839A:232101	Is atrial fibrillation a serious condition? My friend is 45 and has it. Atrial fibrillation increase the risk of stroke  which can be disabling or fatal. Strokes from AF tend to be worse than non-AF strokes. Additionally  if the AF causes a fast pulse for a prolonged period of time  this may lead to weakening of the heart and cause heart failure. A very fast pulse  even for a short period  can precipitate a heart attack in someone with underlying blocked arteries. Atrial fibrillation may be a consequence of structural abnormalities of the heart  which can indeed be serious.  However  if the rhythm disturbance is the only abnormality then it can usually be controlled sufficiently that the patient can be free of symptoms.  In older patients with AF there is significant risk of stroke  but this too can be mitigated by treatment to reduce blood clots.

4389	Q:38902A:41700	Can have WPW prevent a kid from being active? It may  but only if it causes tachycardia (rapid heart beat). The mere presence of WPW does NOT limit activity and is asymptomatic in most individuals. The fast heart rate associated with WPW may be worse during activity for some children  who will then limit their activities to avoid those symptoms. There is also a very small risk of a life threatening condition known as ventricular fibrillation. Special testing is often needed to determine if a child with WPW has this risk.

4390	Q:131634A:197820	How does ventricular tachycardia kill you? When VT occurs at a fast enough rate  there is inadequate time for blood to fill the ventricle during each cycle  cardiac output falls  and blood pressure falls.  Rate is the key variable. As tissue perfusion fails  acidosis  hypoxemia (low oxygen) and hyperkalemia (high potassium) result which leads to further deterioration in rhythm  ie  ventricular fibrillation and death.

4394	Q:16380A:517136	Why does atrial fibrillation cause strokes? Because blood in the left atrium is not propelled forward normally during atiral fibrillation  it allows for the formation of clots. Small areas of blood pooling resembling little eddy currents allow blood to slow down and form clots. If one of these clots is then propelled forward it can travel to the brain  become lodged in a blood vessel and cause a stroke.A clot the size of a pinhead can do it The extremely rapid rates of atrial fibrillation are in fact so fast that they create two problems: the top chamber is not mechanically moving very far at all  so it cannot shake clots loose  in the overactive atrial tissue secretes chemicals which increase the likelihood of clot formation.  These processes come together to substantially increase stroke risk.

4395	Q:102428A:226293	Is an irregular heart beat in fetus always fibrillation? Assessing the fetal heart is a bit problematic. Since they are isolated inside the bag of waters we are limited to detecting rate as fast/ slow/ normal or none. Various factors can lead to various rate changes. The fetal heart is usually beating much fast ; 130-160/min are routine. Stress can speed or slow the rate. When checking newborns  I have never had one with fibrillation in 3 decades.

4397	Q:370604A:811523	What is Cardiac arrhythmia? Is cardiac arrhythmia partly caused by water intoxication? Water intoxication is uncommon  but is a potential cause for dangerous and even fatal arrhythmias. It is very difficult to consume such high quantities of water that it becomes dangerous. Massively excessive water intake results in dilution of the blood's critical electrolytes. This can result in instability of the heart's electrical system  resulting in arrhythmia. Such cases have been reported in marathoners and other athletes who excessively hydrate during competition. The normal heartbeat is from the sinus  located in the top of the heart and is called normal sinus rhythm.  An arrhythmia is anything other than sinus rhythm - supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)  atrial fibrillation  atrial flutter  ventricular tachycardia are all cardiac arrhythmias. They can cause fainting and worse  up to and including death. Water intoxication does not cause them. Alcohol can.

4399	Q:193864A:321464	What makes a pacemaker necessary for atrial fibrillation? My husband is in and out of it every few days  weak  intolerant of beta blockers and has ^BP An essential component in controlling AF is controlling heart rate which tends to be too fast if not treated. Beta blockers are effective but some people are overly sensitive and have  a HR that is too slow. A pacemaker is then indicated to avoid XS bradycardia. Some antiarrhythmic drugs require simultaneous use of a BB for safety as well. A PM protects against pauses and slow HR. Pacemaker are sometimes placed in people who have atrial fibrillation and need to take meds to stop it  but there heart rate is low.  The pacemaker serves to keep the heart rate from going too low  but won't keep someone out of atrial fib.  Medicines called antiarrhhythmics and control of blood pressure will keep patients out of AF. In people who have failed other attempts  we can electrically disconnect the top and bottom chambers  controlling the lower chambers with a pacemaker afterward.  This provides excellent symptom control in well-selected patients but does nothing to stop the fibrillation.  Long term blood thinners are still required. Pacemakers might be implanted as part of a care plan for AF - but this only prevents slow pulses that might come as a result of slow pulse with AF  medications for the AF or after AV-node ablation. Pacemakers themselves can not prevent or control AF.  A pacemaker may help your husband tolerate bblockers at higher dose (prevent the slow pulse) and therefore more effectively treat his AF.

Sometimes weakness or marked fatigue can occur. You can feel your pulse in your wrist or neck and check if it's irregular. While other conditions can cause an irregular pulse  atrial fibrillation is one of the more common reasons. Highly variable: some people are entirely unaware. Others feel their heart beating irregularly or   fluttering   & may notice rapid heart rate.  Commonly people notice fatigue and their exercise capacity is mildly reduced. Sedentary people usually don't notice any change.  Younger people & folks with their 1st bout tend to be more aware. Frequent bouts and older people are less likely to notice.

Blood clots / platelets It is normal to have feelings of anxiety prior to having a major surgey like MV repair.A minimally invasive heart surgery has not been created. A mitral valve repair requires the surgeon to work within the chambers of the heart  so opening the chest cavity is essential to access these valves. During the surgery  the heart must be stopped and blood is bypassed to an external medical device so that blood can be delivered to the body. Pradaxa is a medication that is used to control the presence of and formation of blood clots. Being on a blood thinner is essential as you are in atrial fibrillation which can precipitate blood clots.Talk to your doctor about your concerns. You will learn that the pros of undergoing this surgery will out weigh the cons and improve the quality of your life. Your concerns are normal and anxiety is to be expected. Talk to your doctor and feel free to check on his background perhaps using avvo.com several factors. CHADSV2 score looks at age  heart failure  diabetes  stroke and vascular disease to predict who needs blood thinner. You can look this score up on the internet and calculate your risk easily.

4409	Q:270282A:517116	What makes atrial fibrillation not immediately life threatening while ventricular fibrillation is? Afib has the protection of the AV node which is electrical relay station between the artia and ventricles which slows conduction and limits rate of signals to the ventricles.  With vfib no protection exists The rhythms in the top chamber during atrial fibrillation can reach and exceed 600 bpm. If this were conducted directly to the lower chamber  it would be as fatal as ventricular fibrillation.

4414	Q:671729A:1012097	What is atrial fibrillation and is it serious? AF is the commonest heart rhythm disturbance in humans. In AF  the top chambers (atria) twitter and twitch instead of pumping normally. AF can be serious for some patients  but not for all. Please see your doctor  preferably a cardiologist  ideally an electrophysiologist  and they'll help you sort it out. AFib is a rapid irregular heart rhythm which can decrease heart efficiency as much as 20% in some patients. It can also be associated with clotting and clots travelling around the body to cause stroke or other problems. Some people have atrial fibrillation as their normal rhythm.

4415	Q:17527A:933954	What causes a person to sweat when they have ventricular fibrillation? Ventricular fibrillation  which is usually a very short-lived event  usually occurs in a high sympathetic output state  at times the high sympathetic output actually is the cause for ventricular fibrillation but in any case the end result is the same.  As the sweat glands receive their innervation from this system of nerves  their output increases and the person sweats profusely. Ventricular fibrillation causes the heart to not contract  blood flow to the body ceases and the patient will die if normal or contractile rhythm isn't returned. Sweating is a response to low blood pressure.  When blood pressure drops with ATRIAL fibrillation patients may have sweating. Ventricular fibrillation long enough to cause perceived sweating unlikely unless reversed to better rhythm.

4416	Q:70989A:112826	Please explain Pre-Ventricular Contractions.? Premature ventricular contrActions are xactly that.  The atrium contracts and then the ventricle contractsvserially in a normal cycle.  Once in a while the ventricle can contract prematurely before the atriL impulse gets there.  Hence PVC.  They are often benign. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are beats that come early and start from a site in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). Normally the heartbeat starts from the upper chambers (atria). Patients may feel this as a skip or thump. Often it is not a sign of a serious problem but it should be evaluated by your doctor.

4424	Q:705491A:1106027	Atrial fibrillation - how do you deal with the fatigue? With med slow your heart to around 60-70/ min. BP to around 120 systolic. Sometimes the Betablocker med makes you feel that way; over correction usually at fault. This is a tough one. Fatigue is a plague in America. Start with the simple things: many patients with afib also have sleep apnea; failure to treat the OSA (sleep apnea) renders all other questions moot.

4425	Q:318949A:517129	The patient i'm caring for has rapid atrial fibrillation and dyspnea-- why is she being prescribed heparin? Atrial fibrillation significantly increases the risk of stroke. The heparin could be used for one of two reasons: either to provide anticoagulation while warfarin/Coumadin is being started  or to treat the patient temporarily while a decision is made whether to use long-term medication. Stroke presentation with atrial fibrillation Afib is a dis-coordinated  chaotic heart rhythm where the heart can not effectively move blood the way it should. When blood sits stagnant it can clot. The heparin helps prevent the stagnant blood from clotting to avoid a clot   or   thrombus    being sent to the brain or lungs where it may cause a stroke or PE.

4428	Q:40807A:158510	What is the intervention for atrial fibrillation of paramedics? If atrial fibrillation is seen  and heart rate is very rapid  medications are first given by EMS which usually slow it down. If  however  the heart rate doesn't respond to medications  or the person is critically ill and the blood pressure is extremely low  they need emergent cardioversion (electrical shock) to restart the heart into normal rhythm. Treatment depends on the patient's presentation. For someone with rapid atrial fibrillation who has a stable blood pressure the treatment is often IV medications used to slow the heart rate. The first drug is usually IV diltiazem/Cardizem or a beta blocker. For patients with rapid A-Fib and low blood pressure  immediate cardioversion may be needed.

4430	Q:60988A:90279	what does atrial fibrillation means? Irregular heart rate due to a disease process in the upper chambers of the heart- The atria are the chambers of the heart that pump the blood into the ventricles of the heart. If the atria are not contracting correctly  they fibrillate. The atria are quivering as opposed to contracting in an organized fashion. There are treatment for this and it can be diagnosed with an EKG. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heart beat that results in a fluttering (fibrillating) of the top portion of the heart.

4448	Q:37009A:38926	how does a defibrillator restart a stopped heart? Fibrilating heart is truly trembling muscle units which are not contracting in synchrony to make an efffective stroke volume of the whole chamber or ventricle  each muscle unit is independent thus no leader they are erratic  shock makes all the muscle units discharge and the pace maker cell unit usualy charges up first and sparks the muscles to contract in rhythm to causea effective stroke volume. Defibrillators can reprogram an abnormal rhythm such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation back to normal in some cases. It cannot start electrical activity that has ceased  so if electrical activity isn't there (asystole) defibrillation is of no benefit. A defibrillator restart a heart in an abnormal rhythm  the defibrillator sends an electrical shock to clear the abnormal rhythm  with the hope that the normal heart rhythm will restart.

4450	Q:103526A:170535	I feel a strange fluttering in my chest and just sometimes. Could this be atrial fibrillation? You can feel your pulse to see if it's irregular during an episode. Sometimes what is called an event monitor can be placed to capture the heart's rhythm and have it analyzed by a cardiologist. You should have this evaluated since intermittent atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke and other serious problems. However  there are many other types of arrhythmias that could cause the same symptoms. Also  fluttering in the chest may not be even due to an arrhythmia. Go see a doctor.

4451	Q:42141A:1106007	Does atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response cause ventricular fibrillation? In rare settings where the usual conduction pathway is not in place atrial fibrillation (AF) can lead to ventricular fibrillation (VF) . For example  in WPW an abnormal tract of tissue can conduct impulses directly from the atrium to the ventricle. In rapid AF with WPW this abnormal pathway can allow these impulses into the ventricles and cause VF. In AF thru a normal AV node this will not occur. Generally  the answer to this is a very solid   no.   This is a rare complication of people with another condition (on top of their afib) called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (or WPW). In certain patients having both conditions  the top chamber is too-well connected to the bottom and can trigger ventricular fibrillation.

4454	Q:309324A:1121420	What's the difference between vfib and afib? Ventricular fibrillation is from the bottom chamber; VF is worse; it usually causes cardiac arrest which is often fatal. Atrial fibrillation - from the top chamber- while not as severe  also has significant health risks. It increases the risk of stroke  which can be disabling or fatal. Atrial fib is a rhythm that comes from the upper right chamber. It is a common abnormal rhythm.  It has multiple foci  and doesn't follow a synchronized path. Ventricular fib  come from the lower left chamber and is a rhythm that is not sustainable for life. The heart is unable to adequately pump blood and perfuse the heart.

However  talk to your cardiologist which I am NOT (surgeon) as he will explain you to put you at ease. Ask him if your would be a good candidate for RF ablation. If that is a success you can be cured !!! Most people with WPW have no problem with it. It can however cause VF if certain arrhythmia s like atrial fibrillation happen in a WPW patient.

4461	Q:45086A:266802	What is worse: ventricular fibrillation or atrial fibrillation? Atrial fibrillation (AF) in rare instances can be a life threatening condition. However  many thousands of people each day remain in AF without any limitations as long as their symptoms and risks are addressed. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) on the other hand if not treated immediately (usually by elecetrical defibrillation) is almost always uniformly fatal. ventricular fibrillation is essentially one form of heart attack ... atrial-fibrillation is mainly a problem if the resulting ventricular rate is very fast  which can cause a very low blood pressure ... prolonged atrial-fibrillation can also cause a blood clot to form in the atria  which can break off and go to other parts of the body and cause problems  such as stroke if clot goes to the brain. VF is worse; it usually causes cardiac arrest which is often fatal.  Atrial fibrillation  while not as severe  also has significant health risks.  It increases the risk of stroke  which can be disabling or fatal. Additionally  if the AF causes a fast pulse for a prolonged period of time  this may lead to weakening of the heart and cause heart failure.

Abnormal ECG  specifically some forms of  arrhythmia are not uncommon during panic attacks or episodes of anxiety. Supra-ventricular tachycardia & atrial fibrillation are commonly seen. Reason arrhythmia isn't seen during periods of rest has to do with the Adrenalins released in the blood stream during the anxious episodes. Structural heart disease should be evaluated for if recurrent.

4475	Q:208315A:712218	What is a defibrillator? A defibrillator uses electrical current to reset the rhythm of the heart when it is irregular and too rapid. They are used in cardiac arrest when the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia. They can be used to reset atrial fibrillation either emergently or electively as well. They can be external devices or can even be implanted in the body for patients at risk of arrhythmias. The defibrillator is a device with high-voltage circuitry capable of delivering very high-energy pulses to the heart. These pulses reset the heart and are capable of terminating very fast heart rhythms which could otherwise be fatal. External defibrillators are used on an emergency basis to convert life threatening rapid ventricular arrhythmias. These are also available in a wearable form called a Life Vest. There are also implantable defibrillators inserted in survivors of sudden death or those at risk of sudden death.

4477	Q:88195A:145478	Funny how a diagnosis doesn't mean much till you have it. What is atrial fibrillation? Instead of responding to a single pacemaker in the upper part of the heart  many pacemakers appear and the lower part of the heart can respond to any of them. This results in an irregular rhythm which makes the pumping action of the heart less efficient. It can be caused by alcohol  valvular heart disease  congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Risk of stroke is increased. the electrical impulses in the upper chambers of your heart (mostly originating from the left side) are completely chaotic leading to a quivering motion of these chambers instead of their typical  coordinated pumping function. The lower chambers beat erratically  as the electrical impulses bombard them in a haphazard way.

A combination of medication and non-medication treatments are available for anxiety disorders that can be tailored to work with your atrial fibrillation treatment. You may benefit from therapy to address your anxiety. However talk to your doctor about your anxiety to see if your it is related to your atrial fibrillation. Your anxiety can still be treated with medication despite having atrial fibrillation. Unfortunately atrial fib can cause significant anxiety symptoms in and of itself and should be evaluated and treated by a cardiologist. Also  antidepressants such as SSRIs that are usually recommended to treat anxiety can cause atrial fib! Benzodiazepines would help and not cause it but can cause dependence.

4489	Q:128630A:197048	What's difference between cardiac arrest and asystole? Asystole is one form of cardiac arrest (sudden cardiac death)  but others include dangerous ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation Asystole means there is no electrical activity in the heart and this results in cardiac arrest. There are also other cardiac rhythmns that result in cardiac arrest. Asystole is one of them. Cardiac arrest refers to any situation in which the heart is not pumping blood. This may occur with abnormal electrical activity in the heart in which the heart is quivering ( ventricular fibrillation) or beating so fast in can not pump blood effectively (Ventricular tachycardia ) Asystole  is a kind of cardiac arrest in which the heart is electrically silent ( flat line) on EKG.

4491	Q:198656A:293111	What is the difference between having asystole and having a cardiac arrest? Is a calf a cow? If you are making veal parm? Cardiac Arrest is the loss of pumping ability of the heart. That is measured as Cardiac Output (units L/min). In Cardiac Arrest it is 0.Asystole is usually used to refer to the lack of electrical activity in the heart. If the electrical system could be measured  it would be measured in amps (current or electrons /sec). In Asystole that is 0. Asystole  or a heart with no electrical activity  is how we all end up at death.  A cardiac arrest can start there  but usually starts with a rapid rhythm that has low or no output or a noncontractile rhythm (ventricular fibrillation).  These rhythms are often reversible  Asystole is usually simply death.

It isn't a symptom but an irregular heart beat that can be brought on by other heart problems  thyroid disease  high blood pressure  genetics  and many other causes  many of which we are just beginning to understand. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular rhythm in which the atria beat at nearly 400 beats/min. It is common in older patients as a reflection of aging of the conduction system. In younger patients it can be caused by alcohol and drug abuse. It can also occur when the heart dilates as in congestive heart failure.

4495	Q:222128A:517134	I have atrial fibrillation. Is it safe to drink sodas that contain high levels of caffeine? Boost/Energy/high caffeine drinks are not recommended in patients with AF. Occasional drinks with caffeine like coffee and soda usually do not trigger AF but must be observed for individual responses. If they trigger AF - then need to avoid. Generally speaking the high levels of caffeine will promote increased conduction of the very rapid top chamber rhythm to the bottom chamber of them  leading to palpitations and increased heart rates.

4497	Q:16368A:289877	What are drug treatments for atrial fibrillation? All patients with atrial fibrillation should be placed on anticoagulants to decrease the risk of blood clots from the atrium. Drugs like warfarin or the newer drugs such as 10a inhibitors are used. Drugs such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are used to control the heart rate. Other drugs such as amiodarone or sotalol are used to try to convert atrial fibrillation back to sinus rhythm. The most important treatment is stroke prevention  which is usually done by medications (aspirin or warfarin). Sometimes rate control medications are used  like metoprolol. If the AF is severe enough  stronger anti-arrhythmic medications are used  like propafenone. If these do not work  catheter ablation may be recommended. Pacemaker and AV-node ablation may be used as a last resort.

4498	Q:510142A:819980	How does atrial fibrillation with ventricular standstill differ from fine v-fib? Atrial fibrillation is when the atrium has uncoordinated fibers contracting without mechanical emptying of the atrium while the ventricle contracts in a normal fashion but at irregular intervals. If there were also ventricular standstill  there would be no conduction to the ventricles or contraction.  The ventricles would not be moving.  The heart would either stop or VF would result and then stop Atrial fibrillation  Cardiac  Contraction  Fiber  Fibrillation  Heart  Ventricle

Atenolol will help keep down the rate of atrial fibrillation  but if your mom has what we call systolic heart failure (usually with a low   EF   measured on an imaging test) she'll be expected to see better survival and health benefits taking either Toprol XL or Coreg (carvedilol) instead of atenolol. Coreg is as cheap as atenolol if bought at $4 pharmacies. If the EF is not low  it doesn't matter. She needs to follow up with her cardiologist asap.

4505	Q:608917A:907219	Heart ultrasound came out ok but told I need to see a electro physiology.my heart skips a lot with shortness of breath.can it be deadly? Sometimes  an abnormal electrical conduction pathway in the heart will lead to irregular rhythms. The concern is that these rhythms will   degenerate   into more dangerous rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation. Clearly  Vfib is very dangerous  so preventing it is critical. Do consult your electrophysiologist soon to learn more about your specific condition and what can be done to protect you.

4506	Q:40798A:71432	What are the inclusive characteristics of atrial fibrillation? instead of the top chambers (atria) of heart beating 70-80 times a minute  they fibrillate or quiver at 1000 (red) times a minute  not all impulses are conducted down because of the Av node a gate keeper. This can be seen on an EKG the P waves are replaced with fibrillation waves. Blood clots can form inside the heart when the atria are  fibrillating  these can travel to the brain causing strokes Atrial fibrillation is a condition where the atria of the heart no longer have an organized electrical activity and hence do no longer fulfill their pumping function properly. The typical ECG finding is for an irregularly irregular rhythm with absence of P-waves.

If the atrial fibrillation was from too much thyroxine and not from an underlying heart problem  you should be able to get off the beta blockers and aspirin eventually. If the atrial fibrillation is self-limited and clearly the result of excess thyroxine  the beta blockers and aspirin could eventually be discontinued.  If you have persistent or recurrent episodes of arrhythmia despite proper thyroxine dosing  long-term medications for the atrial fibrillation may be necessary.

4513	Q:72120A:102084	sinus arrythmia what is it and what is the treatment.my doctor has prescribed me cordarone 100 mg once a day? sinus arrhythmia is a condition where your heart rate changes more then normal when breathing in vs. breathing out.  The condition is actually perfectly normal.  The medication you are taking is used to prevent mostly more dangerous ventricular arrhythmias.  Most likely your Dr. saw something that put you at risk for this. Talk to him for more information. sinus node is the first organ inside your hear that is responsible for the heart rate. sinus arrhythmia is when the rate set by the sinus node is no longer regular. perhaps you have atrial fibrillation  that happens when the whole atrium chamber is fibrillating  creating an irregular rhythm of the heart  and cordarone would serve to revert it back to sinus rhythm. Likely u have other more serious arrhythmia. Sinus arrhythmia definition is a normal variation in a human being's pulse rate as it relates to respiratory actions. Most likely no tx is needed.

4515	Q:357493A:509105	If someone's heart stops suddenly from a severe infection such as sepsis  would a defibrillator get the heart working again? Or no  because of the bacteria If someone has severe sepsis or septic shock they can go into cardiac arrest.  If it is due to ventricular fibrillation a defibrillator shock will sometimes correct the rhythm problem.  Other treatments would need to be used if the heart stopped due to asystole.  Once the heart rhythm was stabilized the doctors would have to continue to treat the patient for the underlying infectious process. I need to know more about the case. Sepsis in itself doesn't lead to the heart stopping unless the blood pressure has been quite low. Defibrillating may get the heart working again for a brief period of time  like we do in resuscitation  but the heart will fail again shortly because of the profound metabolic disturbances that made it stop in the first place  and those cannot be corrected quickly.

4517	Q:16557A:60580	How many times can you perform cardioversion to revert atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm? There is no limit.  However  if atrial fibrillation keeps recurring  it would make more sense to explore other options (medications  ablation) rather than to keep undergoing cardioversions - which are not risk free. However  there is not much point in doing it repeatedly if the patient continues to go back into fibrillation especially if on medicine to maintain normal rhythm. Patients can do quite well even if in fibrillation as long as the heart rate is controlled with medication.

4519	Q:230971A:338042	How long will it take for a blood clot to form during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation? Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation means that it comes on suddenly and then often goes away.  Sometimes people can't tell  so it's often recommended to use anticoagulation such as aspirin or coumadin.  When and if a clot will form is an inexact science  but is determined by other risk factors  ultimately with your participation in the decision of whether to take medication or not. It depends on lots of things - is the patient on a blood thinner (it would take longer)?

4520	Q:375629A:992067	How long should I be on blood thinners before I have a cardioversion procedure? I've been in atriol fibrulation for approx 2 months Prior to recieving a cardioversion  your health care provider needs to ensure that there are no clots in the heart. If there is a clot in the heart at the time of the cardioversion  the patient is at high risk for suffering a stroke or a heart attack. Upon the diagnosis of arrhythmia  a patient will be placed on a blood thinning regimen  typically 4-6 weeks prior to undergoing a cardioversion. (A blood test can be performed to ensure your levels are in 'therapeutic' range).However  the presence of clots anywhere in your body and heart could cause the cardioversion procedure to be postposed. Talk to your health care provider about why your procedure has been held. You must be therapeutically anticoagulated for 4 weeks before undergoing elective cardioversion and then stay on the medication for an additional 3 weeks at a minimum.

4526	Q:40805A:407349	What is atrial fibrillation? It is an irregularity of your heart beat.It is quite common in older patients.You need to be under the care of a cardiologist as you may need to be placed on a blood thinner in order to avoid blood clots going into your circulation...this can cause a stroke...so be very attentive to see and follow your doctorr egularly.. Atrial fibrillation (Afib) is the most common sustained rhythm abnormality. It's characterized by an irregular heart rate. The upper chambers of the heart (atrium) do not beat but quiver. Many people don't notice it. But many do. It can lead to strokes in some patients so blood thinners are important. It can be treated with medications  ablation thru IV's in the groin or surgery. See a cardiologis When the small chambers of the heart  ( atria) are beating very fast ( more than 300 beats per minute) the  larger chambers beat fast and irregularly AF is an irregular heart rhythm caused by uncoordinated electrical activity in the atria  or top chambers of the heart.

4528	Q:199691A:294290	If I have a history of atrial fibrillation and tachycardia is it bad that my heart rate has been 144 all day? Sounds like atrial flutter  especially if your heart rate is almost invariate at that rate.  Further testing would be required  but if the diagnosis is flutter  an electrophysiologist could help you bid that problem goodbye for life.  At the very least you could get to the bottom of the diagnosis. If the heart rate is elevated for prolonged periods of time  there is a risk for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy - or weakening of the heart from rapid heart rates.  This is usually reversible once the heart rate is corrected.  You should see your cardiologist for evaluation.

4529	Q:77968A:127490	Explain the problems with caffeine use.? Caffeine is both a stimulant and a weak diuretic. Most people are unaffected with the doses of caffeine found in coffee  chocolate and sodas. However  caffeine may trigger underlying cardiac arrhythmia issues ie. palpitations  SVT  Atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias. As a diuretic  it can cause dehydration. The problem with caffeine is it is now found and many drinks. it is found in sodas  in energy drinks  in candy bars  in health food stores  in coffee  in  teas and herbal supplements  So the real ptroblem is how much caffeine you are consuming because of this you may experience intoxication such as anxiety and witdrawals eg depression Avoiding caffeine  Atrial fibrillation  Supraventricular tachycardia  Caffeine  Dehydration  Stimulant  Cardiac arrhythmia  Diuretic  Fibrillation  Caffeine use Feeling anxious  Avoiding caffeine  Depression  Herbal supplements  Caffeine  Caffeine use  NoDoz  Vivarin
4530	Q:823067A:1187762	Grandmother has atrial fibrillation am I at increased risk? I have sinus tachycardia and high blood pressure It&#x27;s not inherited but everyone is at risk with aging. At 17  the incidence is near 0. By the time you&#x27;re 70  the incidence is 10%. Sinus tachycardia is not a risk factor but high blood pressure is! To avoid AF when you&#x27;re older  get your BP under control and keep it there. You&#x27;re asking a good question that&#x27;s hard to answer. 3 million people in the US have atrial fibrillation  and of those  ~30% have at least 1 family member with afib. But because there&#x27;s so much afib out there  and because the prevalence is so high in advanced age (8% at 80yrs  16%+ at 90) it&#x27;s hard to decide what the specific risk due to any given family member is.

4534	Q:742260A:1092202	What is the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest? A   heart attack   is damage to the heart as a result of the lack of blood flow to the heart. Cardiac arrest means that the heart muscle has stopped beating. Many times  a heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest. But  they are not the same. And there are other causes for cardiac arrest besides heart attacks. Asystole is no beat at all.

4538	Q:154714A:232102	What are the tests for atrial fibrillation? A clue may be irregular pulse on exam.  To make the diagnosis officially  some recording of the heart rhythm needs to be made.  This can be via 12-lead EKG  24-hr holter monitor  or 30-day loop monitor. Sometimes it is picked up by telemetry when in the hospital.  Other tests (echo  stress test) might be ordered when the diagnosis of AF is made  to look for other related heart conditions. If the atrial fibrillation is ongoing then an electrocardiogram will show it.  If it only occurs from time to time  then there are different types of monitors that a patient can use at home to record the heart rhythm; this is another type of electrocardiogram sometimes referred to as an event recorder.

4544	Q:49527A:517149	Can an atrial fibrillation be lethal? When the heart is in atrial fibrillation  it causes blood to clot in the chambers of the heart.  These clots can flow out of the heart and cause strokes.  Strokes can be lethal.  Doctors sometimes put people on a blood thinner called warfarin (coumadin) to help prevent clots in people with atrial fib.  It's a serious condition  but manageable!  Cheers! Only if the atrial rate is conducted in a very rapid fashion to the lower chamber. Your heart has built-in protection to keep this from happening. However  patients with a condition known as Wolff Parkinson White sometimes lack this protection and under the right circumstances can die as a result of atrial fibrillation.

4549	Q:129851A:197389	Can ventricular tachycardia cause blackout? Yes  it certainly can. VT  when fast  gives the heart insufficient time to fill. Consequently  cardiac output (the blood pumped per minute) falls and the brain can be underperfused resulting in blackout. Moreover  VT can be an unstable rhythm that deteriorates to ventricular fibrillation resulting in death. If you have VT  you need to be under the care of a cardiologist or an electrophysiologist. Black-outs (or syncope) are often caused by transient reductions in blood flow to the brain from a variety of causes.  With ventricular tachycardia  the abnormal rhythm may be associated with a reduction in cardiac output and a temporary reduction in brain blood flow that can lead to syncope.

4550	Q:17528A:328300	Why is ventricular fibrillation the most common rhythm of cardiac arrest? Basically we are talking about cardiac arrest.  This means the heart ceases to pump.  The two options are asystole or no heart beats or ventricular fibrillation...rapid chaotic ineffective quivering of the heart.  VF is a common consequence of heart attacks.  It is also a common consequence of enlarged weakened heart (cardiomyopathy).  Two common causes of death. Ventricular fibrillation is the final step before a heart stops beating. Any heart that has not gotten enough blood flow or oxygen for a prolonged period of time will begin fibrillating followed shortly by asystole (no beating at all). In a sense  ventricular fibrillation is the final step every heart likely goes through before it stops beating.

But the electric current has to be synchronized with the heart beat.This is most appropriately called cardioversion than defibrillation  the latter being unsynchronized electric shock for ventricular fibrillation which is a chaotic ineffective rhythm Kidney tends to be rather progressive after a given level.  It is based upon the increased demand for the remaining kidney to continue to process the needs of a given amount of skeletal muscle.

4555	Q:16357A:517214	How can atrial fibrillation and flutter be treated? Medications are used to control the heart or restore normal rhythm. Depending on the risk factors  blood thinners may be prescribed to lower the risk of stroke. Catheter and surgical procedures are also available in some patients to restore sinus rhythm. Both are atrial arrhythmias. They often occur in the same person  sometimes moments apart. In fib  the atrial electrical activity is completely disorganized. In flutter  the atrial rate is usually 300.  In untreated fib  the ventricular rate is usually 160-200. In flutter  the VR is usually 150. Generally speaking  we can attempt to control the rate  we can attempt to keep you in a normal rhythm with medications  or we can attempt a long-term tour of the rhythm using a catheter ablation. There are also surgical treatment for the arrhythmias  but these are generally not first-line treatments unless you have another reason to have heart surgery.

4559	Q:209463A:991459	Can atrial fibrillation be triggered by flying? It is unlikely in commercial airlines that flying can trigger AF. Oxygen levels are kept at < 8000 feet as if on the ground. It can happen if there is additional significant lung disease thereby reducing O2 levels in the blood. Majority of patients with AF due not have an obvious consistent trigger for their episodes. Flying in a commercial aircraft pressurizes to about 8000ft  this level doesn't cause hypoxia so unlikely to be a trigger unless something else like anxiety or other stress supervenes. If something goes on stressful in the aircraft  one could imagine a trigger possibility. I have seen patients get a gas bubble in their GI tract at altitude and be anxious for instance.

4560	Q:16356A:107008	Can you describe the maze procedure for atrial fibrillation? Of pulmonary veins.  To complex to adequately describe beyond that in this space The Maze procedure is not commonly used these days. However  electrophysiologist cardiologist do ablations in the lab that can cure atrial fib  if the patient is a good candidate. In its earliest form  this was a very involved and high risk open heart surgical procedure. Over the years it has been refined to the point where it is much less risky and is often performed as part of other types of cardiac surgery. Catheter-based techniques are also used to treat afib in a less invasive way but should be performed by an experienced cardiac electrophysiologist.

4563	Q:502019A:761742	Please describe the medication: Amiodarone? This medication is a drug used to treat cardiac rhythm disturbances.  It is very effective even in patients with poor ventricular function but caution must be exercised to be vigilant for pulmonary inflammation and thyroid function abnormalities. Amiodarone is an a medication to prevent abnormal heart rhythms that originate in either the atria or ventricles (top or bottom chambers of the heart). Amiodarone is a medication used to suppress extra heartbeats and maintain a normal regular  heart rhythm .It is used most frequently in a low dose to prevent episodes of atrial fibrillation  a heart rhythm that can lead to strokes.

4564	Q:16344A:76466	Can atrial fibrillation be life threatening? Atrial fibrillation increase the risk of stroke  which can be disabling or fatal.  Strokes from AF tend to be worse than non-AF strokes.   Additionally  if the AF causes a fast pulse for a prolonged period of time  this may lead to weakening of the heart and cause heart failure.  A very fast pulse  even for a short period  can precipitate a heart attack in someone with underlying blocked arteries. It can lead to stroke or heart attack of left untreated.

4565	Q:862562A:1233671	Can atrial fibrillation get worse? AF is usually a progressive issue. The progression varies with each person - months  years  decades. It usually increases in frequency or duration over time but there is no defined interval in any specific person. AF causes changes in the electrical properties of the atrium to increase the chances for more AF. Therapy with drugs or ablation may decrease the chances of progression. Talk to you MD.

4566	Q:23627A:72617	Why is atrial fibrillation dangerous? 1 -  If the rate goes too fast...this can become a problem2 - More commonly  when they beat so erratically  it gives an opportunity for the blood to clot in the atria  and then when that clot is pushed into the ventricles it can be pushed into the circulation where it may cause an MI or CVA. Atrial fibrillation causes stagnation of blood in the atrium contributing to the formation of clots there which may travel to the brain causing a stroke or CVA or sudden death.

4570	Q:229164A:330935	What is the effect of atrial fibrillation? Two issues with afib.  The first is stroke.  Afib is a risk for stroke  and thus all patients with afib need some sort of blood thinner.  Whether that is an aspirin or full anticoagulants such as coumadin depends on your risks and your doctor will let you know that.  The second is heart rate.

4573	Q:77900A:125950	Describe the features of cardiac arrest.? Cardiac arrest is synonymous to sudden death and is most commonly caused by ventricular fibrillation - rapid irregular heart beats coming from the bottom heart chambers (over 250 beats per minute) - that lead to inefficient cardiac contractions with resultant circulatory collapse. If CPR is not administered promptly  the person dies. Main reasons for it are heart attacks and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating effectively.  The heart actually ceases to beat or the heart has other electrical rhythm disturbances in which the heat no longer can work as a pump. Because of the lack of blood flow to the brain  patients become comatose  and stop breathing. Unless the condition is reversed quickly  death follows.

4574	Q:88203A:149827	How is atrial fibrillation treated? If heart rate is rapid  medications to slow it.   Depending on your risk factors  blood thinners to decrease stroke risk.  Electrical cardioversion to get back to normal rhythm.  Antiarrythmic medications and/ or ablation treatment to maintain normal rhythm.  Controlling blood pressure and statin medications to treat cholesterol also help. With proper meds many patients do okay with permanent afib With medications to slow down the heart rate or control the heart rhythm  in the right setting blood thinners to minimize the risk of stroke  electrical shock to restore a normal rhythm and also catheter based approaches in order to remove the trigger for Afib There are a variety of medications which can either control the heart rate or convert the rhythm back to normal.

4579	Q:78423A:127451	What sort of problem is atrial fibrillation? When the upper chambers (atria) stop contracting due to electrical chaos  the lower chambers (ventricles) beat rapidly and irregularly. A person with AF may be unaware  aware  or very bothered. If other risk factors are present  the risk of blood clots and stroke may be increased. Treatment involves rate control  anticoagulation  and restoration of normal rhythm - all individualized for each pt  Atrial fibrillation is a disorder of heart rhythm and is caused by abnormal electrical impulses originating around the pulmonary vein that spread to the upper heart chambers (atria). It can cause palpitations  shortness of breath and fatigue. The main risk is formation of blood clots in the heart that can cause stroke or peripheral embolization. Atrial fibrillation occurs when the atria  which deliver blood to the ventricles  receive an abnormal electrical signal and then beat erratically instead of in a coordinated  strong beat. The danger of atrial fibrillation is that the blood in the atria tends to stay there instead of getting pumped fully into the ventricles. This slow moving blood in the atria can then form blood clots.

The underlying heart problem is a greater risk factor than the actual PVC's. PVCs mainly originate from the RV outflow tract  but some originate from from the LV outflow tract  mitral and tricuspid valve annulus. A major concern is that PVCs may initiate VT  polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation. This risk associated with PVCs is usually limited to patients with significant underlying heart disease or at risk of developing heart disease. Need to see a cardiologist.

4591	Q:436941A:793033	What is the definition or description of: Fibrillation? Fibrillation is the rapid  irregular  and unsynchronized contraction of muscle fibers. An important occurrence is with regard to the heart. Cardiac  Contraction  Fiber  Fibrillation  Heart  Muscle
4592	Q:23625A:44593	What is more serious  atrial or ventricular fibrilation? Atrial fibrillation is a rapid irregular rhythm which retains the ability of the heart to contract. The ventricular fibrillation is a rhythm which results in death if not resolved to a better rhythm. Both are serious.  However  VF is often associated with pending collapse of the circulatory system.  VF is a serious complication of acute heart attacks and other heart disease and must be treated aggressively  usually in the ICU setting.  AF can be life threatening  but is often discovered incidentally and some live with it untreated.  Untreated VF is usually fatal.

4593	Q:16346A:54884	Can atrial fibrillation cause ED? Atrial fibrillation is frequently associated with other cardiovascular disease. In patients with cardiovascular disease  damage to the blood vessels is rarely limited to only a single vessel  or even a single organ. The artery supplying the penis is relatively small and relatively easily occluded  and so  cardiovascular disease may unify these two problems. To achieve erection you have to have enough inflow to the penis and basal constrictors working to damp the outflow. AFib in some people can impair blood flow enough to interfere with inflow  especially in patients with atherosclerotic disease in the pelvic vessels. Afib cannot directly cause ED.  Medicines used to treat Afib can impair erections and conditions associated with Afib such as heart failure  coronary disease also can cause ED.

4595	Q:10581A:55085	Why do paramedics use defibrillators with a heart attack patient? Some patients who suffer a heart attack develop deadly heart rhythms called ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.  The heart does not contract properly under these conditions and without external defibrillation to shock the heart back into normal the patient would die. During a heart attack the heart tissues are starved for oxygen. When this happens the heart rhythm deteriorates and instead of beating the heart muscle fibrillates-  sort of wiggles- instead of contracting as a unit. This is called ventricular fibrillation. Delivering a jolt of electricity to the heart interrupts the wiggles and allows the  heart muscle to resume normal contractions.

4596	Q:45070A:312632	I understand that atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia. Is ablation used to treat only AFIB or other arrhythmia conditions? Ablation is a procedure used to treat many different types of dysrhythmias; atrial fibrillation is only the latest in a long line of dysrhythmias treated successfully by ablation. Ablative therapy has been used to treat supraventicular tachycardias such as AV nodal reentrant tachycardia  atrial flutter  Wolff-Parkinson-White and others. It is also used to treat types of ventricular tachycardias. Ablation can treat atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter  but can also treat other conduction abnormalities  such as Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome  which involves an abnormal electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles of the heart. Ablation is great for a lot of different kinds of heart rhythms.  Tens of thousands of ablations are done every year and the majority to substantial success. Ablation is used to treat many different cardiac rhythm problems  both in the upper and lower chambers of the heart. It is safe and highly effective. Many patients may be cured of their rhythm problems with ablation. Catheter ablation is available for many different types of arrhythmias - ventricular tachycardia  SVT  as well as atrial fibrillation.  they are all a bit different in technique as well as risks/success rates.

4598	Q:16374A:106185	What is atrial fibrillation? Is it serious? Rhythm arising from atria.  Yes  it is serious AF is a disorder of heart rhythm in which the electrical activity of the upper chambers becomes chaotic  contraction stops  & the ventricles beat too rapidly. In your age group  most people feel better with restoration of normal rhythm.  Medication can control the rate and correct the rhythm; if not  electricity will. If necessary  ablation can correct it. Blood thinners are sometimes needed. Atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia  often unclear in origin  but usually due to enlarged upper heart chambers (atria).

4606	Q:242705A:351552	What can we do if my mother has been in atrial fibrillation for the last three months? The most important question is what previous treatment has been tried for the atrial fibrillation. If the answer is none  a cardioversion and use of an antiarrhythmic drug may be a reasonable option. If your mother has repeatedly failed this treatment  a cardiac electrophysiologist may be able to assist you. There are many options for someone in this situation. She may need to consider going on a blood thinner to prevent a blood clot in the heart  as well as medications to control her heart rate.

4608	Q:370624A:820188	What can make my atrial fibrillation worse? What are the risks that my atrial fibrillation will become worse? (more symptomatic) Atrial fibrillation is an interesting heart rhythm because some people do not feel it at all while other people may be highly symptomatic with a very poor quality of life. There is a chance that your atrial fibrillation will become more symptomatic over time  but it is impossible to predict. Generally speaking  controlling all the cardiovascular risk factors gives you the best chance of preventing or minimizing symptoms from atrial fibrillation. This means maintaining good blood pressure and cholesterol and avoiding tobacco. The symptoms of atrial fibrillation can get better or worse. But this does not mean the a fib is itself getting worse. Anything that makes you heart go faster  will give you a more significant sensation. Things like fever  stimulants (caffeine)  stress  excitement will make your heart beat faster. But  again  this does not mean your condition is at all worse. Medications can also affect symptoms.

4609	Q:375899A:810454	Could a pacemaker keep an individuals heart beating after a cardiac arrest. If the answer to the above question is yes  Then how long would it continue to assist the heart in beating and would it help to prevent brain damage until medical help arrives. Yes. A pacemaker is placed in the heart to prevent the heart from beating too slow. As an example a pacemaker may be set to ensure the heart beats 70 times a minute. If your intrinsic heart beats slower than 70  or if your heart stops beating (as in a cardiac arrest)  then the pacemaker will send an electrical impulse to the heart to keep beating at 70 beats per minute.To avoid brain damage  the person must also be breathing normally. If the person is not breathing normally (10-20 breaths per minute)   CALL 911 and initate CPR. In most circumstances the term cardiac arrest refers to a rhythm problem called ventricular fibrillation. Eventually there is no electrical activity at all and even a pacemaker cannot stimulate the heart.

Recent studies suggest that up to 30 percent of all people with atrial fibrillation may have a history of the condition in their family.. There are rare cases of genetic atrial fibrillation  however for the most part appears to be a degenerative condition caused by aging and heart disease.

4614	Q:24756A:81107	How much does atrial fibrillation affect longevity? Atrial fibrillation will (provided you don't have an exceedingly rare condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White) not lead directly to your death  but there are several ways it can hasten it.Stroke is the biggest risk of atrial fibrillation and your risk with fibrillation can be directly calculated from certain risk factors.

The early ischemia of the heart muscle can trigger a life ending rhythm(usually ventricular fibrillation). On the other hand if that doesn't happen but a large mass of muscle dies  the ensuing shock or heart failure can kill days or longer later. Depends upon extent and location of the attack.  Heart attack occurs when blood supply is inadequate for the metabolic needs of the heart.  When this occurs for a prolonged period pieces of the heart die.  If this piece is very large ( like occlusion of the main vessel) or is located in a critical area ( such as the electrical centers) - Game Over!

4616	Q:120975A:186963	Why defibrillation is done till a patient is on flatline? Actually  we don't defibrillate when a patient is flat-lined.  That is a TV thing.  We can only use the defribrillator  when someone is in ventricular fibrillation (VF)  thus the term  defibrillation.  VF is an abnormal rhythm  and is not resulting in a pulse  so there is no blood pressure.

4617	Q:16202A:929295	Is digitalis used to cure abnormal heart rhythms? No. Digitalis also referred to as digoxin can be used to treat symptoms of abnormal rhythms such as atrial fibrillation. It may help keep someone in a normal sinus rhythm or help control the ventricular rate. While it may help with symptoms  digoxin does not   cure   dysrhythmias. In fact  like most anti-arrhythmic medication  it can-especially at high doses- cause dysrhythmias. Digitalis has a long history of treating congestive heart failure by stimulating the heart muscle.

Age and other chronic medical conditions will likely guide your therapy also The most important treatment is stroke prevention  which is usually done by medications (aspirin or warfarin). Sometimes rate control medications are used  like metoprolol. If the AF is severe enough  stronger anti-arrhythmic medications are used  like propafenone. If these do not work  catheter ablation may be recommended. Pacemaker and AV-node ablation may be used as a last resort.

4622	Q:35881A:75557	What's the difference between atrial flutter and SVT- and can they happen at the same time? SVT stands for Supraventricular Tachycardia  or a fast heartbeat coming from the top part of the heart.  There are many fast rhythms coming from the top of the heart:  Atrial tachycardia  atrial fibrillation  junctional tachycardia  and PSVT (paroxyxmal SVT)...  Atrial flutter is one of these rhythms  and is characterized by a regular  rapid rate of the atrium typically between 290 and 310 bpm. Both originate with the   pace-maker   in the right atrium. In SVT  it leads to a sinus rhythm over 100-140 beats per min (bpm). Atrial flutter is a specific type of SVT that causes (by definition) an atrial rate of around 300 bpm. Depending on the electrical conduction of that heart  it will lead to a ventricular rate of some multiple of 300 (150  100  75  etc).

4623	Q:49528A:49071	How effective are ablations for atrial fibrillations? I'm going to assume you're 25 and have   paroxysmal   atrial fibrillation (afib some of the time  but not most of the time). In that case  an initial procedure using current techniques is 50-70% likely to leave you free of fibrillation. A second procedure if needed will increase that to 70-85%. Some next generation ablation techniques may give even better results than these. Ablation for regular tachcardias such as supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation is very successful (>90%). Ablation for atrial fibrillation which is chaotic rhythm is either not successful or if initial success  the positive outcome is not sustained. In other words there is a high rate of recurrence.

4624	Q:491873A:735712	What r the long term side effects to being 100% paced with a dual lead pacemaker?  I have one &am paced100%@bottom  70%@top  I am almost 30yrs old. There is an ongoing small risk of infection. There is also a small operative risk associated with changing the pacemaker and the wires that attach to your heart. Sometimes the old wires need to be removed and this carries a risk as well. There is  very low risk of device malfunction. Very rarely patients can develop weaker heart muscle from chronic pacing. All combined the risks remain low. Long term ventricular pacing can lead to atrial fibrillation (AF) or development of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. One should monitor the pacemaker to identify silent AF episodes and periodically obtain an echocardiogram to monitor LV size and function. It could be helpful to see an electrophysiologist to explore programming or upgrade options of the pacemaker to prevent the above. Right ventricular apical pacing(tradtional lead position) greater than 40%is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation  ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.  New pacing algorythms(programming) and alternative right ventricular lead positions that permit more natural impulse conduction  may reduce this risk.

4625	Q:16383A:289872	Would a pacemaker repair atrial fibrillation? Efforts to use pacemakers to suppress atrial fibrillation have generally been unsuccessful.  That said  we do a procedure where we electrically disconnect the top and bottom chambers so the fibrillation doesn't bother you anymore.  That requires a pacemaker to be implanted and works quite well for appropriately selected patients. No  it doesn't repair atrial fibrillation. Pacemakers might be implanted as part of a care plan for AF - but this only prevents slow pulses that might come as a result of medications for the AF or after AV-node ablation. Pacemakers themselves can not prevent or control AF.

4627	Q:686891A:1034231	What is cardio version? Cardioversion varies from life threatening emergency conditions in cases of ventricular fibrillation - called   defibrillation  -cases of cardiac arrest -  to semi elective situations for conditions such as atrial fibrillation. In all such cases  the goal is to jolt your heart with an electric shock to re-establish a normal   sinus   rhythm. converts rhythm from atrial fibrillation to regular sinus rhythm.

4642	Q:80691A:133538	Is arrhythmia curable? Many types of arrhythmia are due to microscopic electrical pathways or very small groups of heart cells that cause an abnormal heart rate. These types of arrhythmia can usually be cured with a catheter procedure known as ablation. Less commonly a surgical approach is used to cure some arrhytmias. There are many types of arrhythmias  and the answer depends on the type. Atrial fibrillation can be controlled with medications or cured with an ablation procedure. Ventricular tachycardia often requires a pacemaker/ICD or an ablation procedure. Ventricular fibrillation is deadly if not addressed immediately.

4643	Q:874788A:1252627	I have atrial fibrillation and am considering whether or not to have cardioversion? Make sure that your provider is either keeping you on good anticoagulation for the 3 weeks before or performs a &quot;TEE&quot; procedure at the time of cardioversion to minimize the stroke risk. The advantages of doing the cardioversion are that you&#x27;ll know whether you feel better in sinus rhythm than you do with fib  and you&#x27;ll know how easily you can hold normal (sinus) rhythm. The shorter the duration of atrial fibrillation the more effective cardioversion is at converting the rhythm. When underlying cardiac pathology like mitral insufficiency or stenosis is present  keeping the patient out of atrial fibrillation or converting the rhythm is quite problematic.The procedure is low risk for most people if they have been anticoagulated for several weeks beforehand as needed Atrial fibrillation  Cardioversion  Cerebral vascular accident  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Sinus  Stroke Atrial fibrillation  Cardiac  Cardioversion  Fibrillation  Heart  Mitral regurgitation  Pathology  Rhythm  Stenosis  Stricture Atrial fibrillation  Cardioversion  Cerebral vascular accident  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Sinus  Stroke Atrial fibrillation  Cardiac  Cardioversion  Fibrillation  Heart  Mitral regurgitation  Pathology  Rhythm  Stenosis  Stricture Atrial fibrillation  Cardioversion  Cerebral vascular accident  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Sinus  Stroke Atrial fibrillation  Cardiac  Cardioversion  Fibrillation  Heart  Mitral regurgitation  Pathology  Rhythm  Stenosis  Stricture Atrial fibrillation  Cardioversion  Cerebral vascular accident  Fibrillation  Rhythm  Sinus  Stroke Atrial fibrillation  Cardiac  Cardioversion  Fibrillation  Heart  Mitral regurgitation  Pathology  Rhythm  Stenosis  Stricture
4644	Q:241920A:350370	Can you die from a cardia arrhythmia? The arrhythmias named ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia both are often lethal  especially fibrillation.

4648	Q:625152A:939978	Atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism. Are there any similarities? Can lead to atrial arrhythmia but aFib more common with hyper not hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism  (not hypothyroidism) is associated with atrial fibrillation. Sometimes  over treatment of hypothyroidism may result in hyperthyroidism  and atrial fibrillation could result. Atrial fibrillation  Fibrillation  Hypothyroidism  Underactive thyroid
4649	Q:276578A:394873	What is mild concentric left ventricular hyper trophy? Hypertrophy means the wall of the heart is thicker than normal. Concentric means the distribution of the thickening is uniform and not localized to one part of the heart muscle. There are multiple causes. Mildly increased thickening of the left ventricular walls in a uniform fashion.  Most common reason is hypertension Muscle High blood pressure
4650	Q:40991A:85860	What is the pathophysiology of the defibrillator? The device has an antenna that monitors the electrical activity of the heart. If the recorded parameters fit those of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation  the device will charge its capacitor and deliver programmed shocks to try and return the rhythm to normal. It is a computer and programmed to do its functions. They are very effective but not perfect Assuming the problem is ventricular fibrillation  the chaotic and fatal cardiac arrhythmia  one must know there are hierarchies of pacemakers controlling the heart rhythm (fastest one usually wins).  By shocking the heart into functional standstill  the next available fastest stable pacemaker tissue takes over  usually sinus node > ectopic atrial > junctional > idioventricular/Purkinje.

4651	Q:16570A:977276	What is digoxin's role before a cardioversion? Digoxin is used  especially in cases of atrial fibrillation to control the heart rate  usually in conjunction with anticoagulation to thin the blood.  Cardioversion might then be performed once improved heart rate control had been acheieved with the medications  or because the medications were not sucessful. Before cardio version we generally try to slow a rapid supra ventricular rhythm. Digoxin is one of the drugs we may choose to do this. It helps slow the rate by slowing conduction of impulses in the heart. We use other drugs also  so it's doctors choice which agent the believe is best for the situation.

4652	Q:370961A:592251	What are the solutions to an irregular heart beat? What causes the heart to skip and what is the cure? There are many causes. If you are symptomatic it can be treated with medications. If it is refractory then ablation is a choice. The answer to your question depends on the type of irregular heart beat. The sensation of a skipped heart beat is most commonly caused by Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) or Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs). Neither of these conditions are dangerous  but in some circumstances they can be associated with other heart conditions. A sustained irregular heart beat lasting hours or longer is usually atrial fibrillation  a common arrhythmia with several potential complications. I would recommend that you talk with your doctor if you are having this symptom  because the first step is an accurate diagnosis. Depending on what is found  you may need nothing done but you may benefit from treatment.

4654	Q:36965A:187220	Can a defibrillator restart a heart that stopped? Defibrillators are effective when the heart stops due to life threatening heart rhythms By   stopped   it is implied a complete absence of any rhythm or electrical activity  other wise known as  asystole. Defibrillation is the application of electricity to the heart to treat chaotic electrical transmission through the heart. This is seen in several rhythms atrial fibrillation/ flutter  ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillation does not treat asystole. Depending on why the heart stopped  debrillators can definitely restart a heart that has stopped. It is always worth a try.

4655	Q:113706A:517218	Does it matter if a person has atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation? atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter can cause the heart to work poorly.  This can create symptoms of chest pain  shortness of breath  palpitations  or dizziness.  More importantly  in certain circumstances  these arrhythmias can cause strokes which are quite debilitating. if a pt has chronic afib or flutter   their rate is well controlled  and they are well anticoagulated shouldnt be a problem especially if the pt is asymptomatic . if they have symptoms such as palpitations or shortness of breathe despite on a good medical program they need to be converted or ablated . rate controll is important to avoid a cardiomyopathy and anticoagulation to prevent a stroke. While the immediate consequences of the knowledge may not be substantial (both can result in increased stroke risk and generally speaking patients with one heart risk for the other)  isolated atrial flutter is often readily amenable to cure by catheter ablation procedures (85-98%). Atrial fibrillation is also amenable to such a procedure  though the success rates can be much lower (perhaps 70%).
